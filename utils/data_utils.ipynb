Inspired by the story, Justine van der Leun, an American writer living in South Africa, decided to introduce it to an American audience. But as she delved into the case, the prevailing narrative started to unravel. Why didn't the eyewitness reports agree on who killed Amy Biehl? Were the men convicted of the murder actually responsible for her death? And then van der Leun stumbled on another brutal crime committed on the same day, in the very same area. The story of Amy Biehl's death, it turned out, was not the story hailed in the press as a powerful symbol of forgiveness, but was in fact more reflective of the complicated history of a troubled country.\\nWe Are Not Such Things is the result of van der Leun's four years investigating this strange, knotted tale of injustice, violence, forgiveness, and redemption. It is a gripping journey through the bizarre twists and turns of this case and its aftermath--and the story that emerges of what happened on that fateful day in 1993 and the decades that followed provides an unsparing account of life in South Africa today. Like Katherine Boo and Tracy Kidder, van der Leun immerses herself in the lives of her subjects. With her stark, moving portrait of a township and its residents, she provides a lens through which we come to understand that the issues at the heart of her investigation--truth and reconciliation, loyalty, justice, race, and class--are universal in scope and powerful in resonance. We Are Not Such Things reveals how reconciliation is impossible without an acknowledgment of the past, a lesson just as relevant to America today as to a South Africa still struggling with the long shadow of its history., consisting of 448 pages.\",\n",

The police are actively investigating it, as well, and it\\'s not even clear that the woman was murdered. It will take a little cloak-and-dagger, dress-up, and finesse for the McKinleys to get to the bottom of it, but they aren\\'t the kind to give up.\\nAs they troll for leads and work through the skeletons in the reporter\\'s closet, they unearth a few suspects, but they\\'ll need to carve out the whole truth if they\\'re going to find her killer. If they do so fast enough, there might even be time for a little trick-or-treating., consisting of  pages.',\n",

The deaf, mentally disabled man who worked at their dry-cleaners has died of a sleeping-pill overdose, and Paola's kind heart can't take the idea that he lived and died without anyone noticing him, or helping him.\\nTo please her, Brunetti begins to ask questions. He is surprised when he finds that the man left no official record: no birth certificate, no passport, no driver's license, no credit cards. The man owns nothing, is registered nowhere. As far as the Italian government is concerned, the man never existed. It is even more surprising because, with his physical and mental handicaps, both he and his mother were entitled to financial support from the state. And yet, despite no official record of the man's life, there is his body.\\nStranger still, the dead man's mother is reluctant to speak to the police and claims that her son's identification papers were stolen in a burglary. As clues stack up, Brunetti suspects that the Lembos, a family of aristocratic copper magnates, might be somehow connected to the death. But could anyone really want this sweet, simple-minded man dead?\\nDonna Leon's Brunetti series has gotten better and better in recent years, with countless reviews praising her remarkable ability to keep the books fresh, the depths of feeling genuine.

Previous books and films, including the brilliant 1967 movie starring Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, have emphasized the supposed glamour of America's most notorious criminal couple, thus contributing to ongoing mythology. The real story is completely different -- and far more fascinating.\\nIn Go Down Together: The True, Untold Story of Bonnie and Clyde, bestselling author Jeff Guinn combines exhaustive research with surprising, newly discovered material to tell the real tale of two kids from a filthy Dallas slum who fell in love and then willingly traded their lives for a brief interlude of excitement and, more important, fame. Their timing could not have been better -- the Barrow Gang pulled its first heist in 1932 when most Americans, reeling from the Great Depression, were desperate for escapist entertainment. Thanks to newsreels, true crime magazines, and new-fangled wire services that transmitted scandalous photos of Bonnie smoking a cigar to every newspaper in the nation, the Barrow Gang members almost instantly became household names on a par with Charles Lindbergh, Jack Dempsey, and Babe Ruth. In the minds of the public, they were cool, calculating bandits who robbed banks and killed cops with equal impunity.\\nNothing could have been further from the truth. Clyde and Bonnie were perhaps the most inept crooks ever, and their two-year crime spree was as much a reign of error as it was of terror. Lacking the sophistication to plot robberies of big-city banks, the Barrow Gang preyed mostly on small mom-and-pop groceries and service stations. Even at that, they often came up empty-handed and were reduced to breaking into gum machines for meal money. Both were crippled, Clyde from cutting off two of his toes while in prison and Bonnie from a terrible car crash caused by Clyde's reckless driving. Constantly on the run from the law, they lived like animals, camping out in their latest stolen car, bathing in creeks, and dining on cans of cold beans and Vienna sausages. Yet theirs was a genuine love story. Their devotion to each other was as real as their overblown reputation as criminal masterminds was not.\\nGo Down Togetherhas it all -- true romance, rebellion against authority, bullets flying, cars crashing, and, in the end, a dramatic death at the hands of a celebrity lawman hired to hunt them down. Thanks in great part to surviving Barrow and Parker family members and collectors of criminal memorabilia who provided Jeff Guinn with access to never-before-published material, we finally have the real story of Bonnie and Clyde and their troubled times, delivered with cinematic sweep and unprecedented insight by a masterful storyteller., consisting of 468 pages.\",\n",

       " \"This book tittled The Appeal is a Hardcover edition published by  in Unknown Month  about John Grisham is now an institution -- a writer whose bestselling status is assured, So assured, in fact, that expectations for each new book are as high as can be imagined. Does The Appealmake the grade? And will it appeal to Grisham admirers -- or disappoint them?The stakes in the novel's plot are high: corporate crime on the largest scale. The duo of lawyers at the centre of the narrative are Mary and Wes Grace, who succeed in a multimillion dollar case against a chemical company, who have polluted a town with dumped toxic waste. A slew of agonising deaths have followed this, but lawyers for the chemical company appeal, and a variety of legal shenanigans are employed -- and it is certainly not clear which way the scales of justice will be finally balanced.\\nAs ever with Grisham, the mechanics of plotting are key, and the characterisation is functional rather than detailed. But it is (as always) more than capable of keeping the reader totally engaged. Given John Grisham's much-publicised conversion to born-again Christianity, it's intriguing to note here the implicit criticism of the moral majority's religious values, but that is hardly central to the enterprise. What counts is the storytelling, and while the writing is as straightforward and uncomplicated as ever, few readers will put down The Appealonce they have allowed it to exert its grip on upon them. --Barry Forshaw, consisting of 286 pages.\",\n",

       "[\"I haven't read a fun mystery book in a while and not sure I've ever read Poirot. Was looking for a fun read set in France while I was on holiday there and this didn't disappoint! Fast paced and good mystery. \\n One that struck me was how similar Poirot is to Sherlock. They are both detectives, have a ex-military sidekick who is telling the story, and solve mysteries using their superior wit. Poirot seems like a French Sherlock. I'm curious if he was inspired by Sherlock.\",\n",
       " 'A fun, fast paced science fiction thriller. I read it in 2 nights and couldn\\'t put it down. The book is about the quantum theory of many worlds which states that all decisions we make throughout our lives basically create branches, and that each possible path through the decision tree can be thought of as a parallel world. And in this book, someone invents a way to switch between these worlds. This was nicely alluded to/foreshadowed in this quote: \\n \"I think about all the choices we\\'ve made that created this moment. Us sitting here together at this beautiful table. Then I think of all the possible events that could have stopped this moment from ever happening, and it all feels, I don\\'t know...\" \"What?\" \"So fragile.\" Now he becomes thoughtful for a moment. He says finally, \"It\\'s terrifying when you consider that every thought we have, every choice we could possibly make, branches into a new world.\" \\n This book can\\'t be discussed without spoilers. It is a book about choice and regret. Ever regret not chasing the girl of your dreams so you can focus on your career? Well Jason2 made that choice and then did regret it. Clearly the author is trying to tell us to optimize for happiness - to be that second rate physics teacher at a community college if it means you can have a happy life. I\\'m being snarky because while there is certainly something to that, you also have to have meaning in your life that comes from within. I thought the book was a little shallow on this dimension. In fact, all the characters were fairly shallow. Daniela was the perfect wife. Ryan the perfect antithesis of Jason. Amanda the perfect loyal traveling companion, etc. This, plus the fact that the book was weak on the science are what led me to take a few stars off - but I\\'d still read it again if I could go back in time - was a very fun and engaging read. \\n If you want to really minimize regret, you have to live your life to avoid it in the first place. Regret can\\'t be hacked, which is kind of the point of the book. My favorite book about regret is Remains of the Day. I do really like the visualization of the decision tree though - that is a powerful concept. \\n \"Every moment, every breath, contains a choice. But life is imperfect. We make the wrong choices. So we end up living in a state of perpetual regret, and is there anything worse? I built something that could actually eradicate regret. Let you find worlds where you made the right choice.\" Daniela says, \"Life doesn\\'t work that way. You live with your choices and learn. You don\\'t cheat the system.\"',\n",

       " 'An amazing and unique creation: JJ Abrams and Doug Dorst created what reads like a classic work of fiction - something you can easily imagine having read in English class - and then wrote a intriguing side story in the margins. A grad student (Eric) has left his annotated copy of SOT (Ship of Theseus) in the library, and an undergrad (Jen) finds it and replies to his annotations. This leads to them making exciting discoveries about the book, and also falling in love. \\n The first thing is this book is just beautifully printed. It looks and feels like a classic book, to the point where people would ask me why I\\'m reading such an old book. The marginalia feels real, and I can only imagine how hard that was to print. This is one that will be cool to keep on the shelves. Only complaint is the inserts are a cool idea, but they fall out all the time, and at this point I have no idea which pages they were supposed to be on. \\n The most interesting thing about this book to me is that it\\'s a blueprint for how people discuss books. Sometimes they discuss the content of the book. Other times they use the content as a jumping off point to have a personal discussion. The nature of this book shows both, almost split 50/50. A key difference with this book - and the genius of it - is that most of us have to rely on memory to start a conversation with someone about a particular event or passage in the book. Here, our characters can literally underline a phrase like \"relationships\" and then talk about what is happening in their relationship at the moment. \\n One thing I didn\\'t realize until later in the book is that the ship of Theseus is a real thing - it\\'s an ancient Greek philosophical question - if you replace all the parts of something, is it still the same object? This inspires the ship that S is captured on, which sails through the mists of time, always getting fixed when needed. It\\'s a ship that can\\'t die. Or a series of ships :) \\n I found the story of Jen & Eric a lot more compelling than the SOT story. They were real characters that you could relate to. SOT felt like books you read in english class - a bit obtuse - and I still don\\'t understand it all. But don\\'t get me wrong - it\\'s a pretty cool story. I particularly enjoyed the themes - like how it all begins and ends with water, and also how it was a lot about Straka\\'s regret to fulfill his mission instead of living his life with his true love. Kind of like how S was on a mission, but didn\\'t really know why - he just found himself caught up in it.',\n",
       " 'The Name of the Rose is a thrilling Dan Brown-esque murder mystery set in a 14th century Italian monastery. It really is two stories - the story of the murder mystery, and that of political climate in Italy at the time. And of course, they nicely interweave throughout. \\n The history the book brought was one of my favorite parts. I learned about how the church controlled so much of the world, how even then it was already starting to fall from power, why saints are so prevalent in Italy, and more. I learned about Franciscans and Dolcians and minorites, and poverity and false monks. Poverty was a big theme, which came through on several levels: rebellions by poor people and religious leaders stepping in to lead the masses, and also an a debate about the role the Church should have in society. \\n I loved brother William of baskerville. He was Sherlock Holmes-esque (so that can\\'t be a coincidence he\\'s from Baskerville right?) in his deductive reasoning and approach. I think my favorite moment of his was when he had no time left to solve the crime he said \"when a man has little time, he must take care to maintain his calm. We must act as if we had eternity before us.\" \\n I took one star off because I often found myself skipping large sections that went into flowery details of something (often history) that just seemed irrelevant. \\n The book was also a lot about change. The monks were so set in their ways and in their dogma that you could see how it likely took generations before a viewpoint could really change. The focus on humor for instance and the dogmatic viewpoint of Jorge was in my opinion simply nothing more than fear of change. We all know that the introduction of humor and the divine comedy didn\\'t ruin the world. \\n The library was one of the greatest in the world at the time. I would love to have seen it. Yet it was almost impossible to access, and that very lack of accessibility is what ultimately led to it\\'s destruction. Seems like the message is that knowledge should be open and free and and keeping it locked up can be more dangerous than not.',\n",

We were going to learn about the secrets of the Masons, and about the \"ancient wisdom\" that has been lost through the ages. Sounds cool - I wanted to learn more about the ancient wisdom. But the end of the book just fell really flat. The villian was predictable, and we learned nothing about this ancient wisdom. \\n I also have to say that I almost fell out of bed laughing with Dan Brown plugged Twitter at the end of the book. To be fair, he\\'s right - people are excited about Twitter because it (along with many other websites) is helping cause a shift in our society. But I can\\'t help wondering if 5 years from now, when Twitter is MySpace, people will read that and think \"wtf?\".',\n",

Though the main players - Scaramanga, Goodnight, and Felix Leiter - were all still there - but there was no midget! Bond books are simple, yet somehow still very compelling. The way Flemming wrote, Bond seems much more human and susceptible, yet determined and focused him - in the movies he seems more superhuman. I think Daniel Craig's movies are actually bringing that aspect of bond back a little bit. \\n In any event I greatly enjoyed the duel between Scaramanga and Bond.\",\n",
       " '** spoiler alert ** \\n Kind of Dan Brown-esque but with a fun geek twist. And the geek in me enjoyed it. Would have given it four stars, but I didn\\'t love the ending. It was a truly interesting premise though: A computer programmer dies of cancer and leaves behind a program that kicks into life when it sees his obituary in the news, and wreaks havoc with some unknown goal in sight. \\n In the first half of the book I had a lot of fun trying to imagine the program that Sobol wrote. It was basically a big logic tree, where each possibly outcome in the real world was accounted for in the program. It would have taken a lot of preparation and attention to detail to go through all the possible outcomes and not missing anything, and one bug could make the whole thing fail. Wouldn\\'t that be embarrassing? I guess Sobol had some good unit tests? \\n In the second half of the book (trying to not give anything away), the AI goes beyond what I think a skilled programmer could do today. Certainly an interesting thought exercise, but playing up a little bit too much on our fear of \"oh my gosh all information is digital now so a hacker could just take out our whole society!\" Many a hacker has stayed up all night with the same thoughts! \\n What I really want to know is where I can get some of those voice projector/sensors?

I tore through it in one day! \\n It really dove into what it\\'s like to be in the spy world. A world where, as Le Carre mentions several times in the novel, the only rule is to do what\\'s best for your country. When you play that kind of game morals are thrown out the window. Murder, traitorism, disloyalty - are all ok in the name of great good. And operatives who live in this world have a hard time \"coming in from the cold\" - as did Laemas. \\n The description of how Laemas had to go to personally go to pieces in order to get thrown in jail and get recruited by the Germans was impressive. He had to basically pretend to become an alcoholic, start sucking at his job, ostracize all his friends and anyone he met, and hit total rock bottom, until he was thrown in jail. That\\'s impressive. Not something I think most people could do - which is why the Spy world is such and interesting one. \\n The issue of the unmorality of the spy world was Liz (Laemas\\' love interest)\\'s main issue with the events. But Laemas was hardened to it and still looked at it from the greater good angle - though people were killed in the end it was a win for London, after all.

I guess it wasn't such a big deal back then? \\n - one caper delved into the history of the Mormons, which was very interesting\",\n",
       " 'The second volume of the masterful Sherlock Holmes. The first was probably better, but this was a very good read as well. I have all the respect for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, as he really makes you believe in Holmes\\' genius. \\n One interesting tidbit is that he killed Holmes off at the end of the last book, because he thought he was \"obscuring my higher work\". Ironic since none of his other work has any popularity. Due to popular demand, Holmes returned 20 years later. \\n A great quote: \\n \"I have serious thoughts of writing a small monograph upon the uese of dogs in the work of the detective ... A dog reflects the family life. Whoever saw a frisky dog in a gloomy family, or a sad dog in a happy one? Snarling people have snarling dogs, dangerous people have dangerous ones.

I feel like it was almost an advertisement for the 12 Step programs. Perhaps someone who has been through one may feel differently about it though.

Sometimes too much disturbing detail was offered. I find the subject of child abuse needs to be handled sensitively. Tragically, this is something that occurs far too commonly in \"real life\". The average person is not educated on how to handle the details of such a tragic occurrence (as someone involved in social work or police work may be, for example) and I feel it could be upsetting to many readers, even those who may have experienced it.

The story that unfolds seeks to shed light on what truly happened as well as what happens when the magician begins to hunt them down. \\n I struggled to finish the story. It was not that the story wasn't well written, but I found myself not caring so much what happened. The characters were somewhat stereotypes and I did not find myself attached to any of them.

The baby was never found. Angela and her husband Nick carried on after their devastating loss but Angela never fully recovered. When the bones of an infant are found at a construction site, she is sure the body is that of her long-gone Baby Alice. \\n Kate is a brilliant newspaper journalist who uncovers news stories the old-fashioned way: through leg work and research and determination. She was also featured in the author\\'s previous book \\'The Widow\\' which I am now going to read! I loved Kate\\'s style. While this book started off just a tiny bit slow, it picked up the pace in the middle and thundered toward an unbelievably shocking conclusion. \\n \"I\\'ve always thought that\\'s a funny saying. Let sleeping dogs lie. Because sleeping dogs always wake up eventually, don\\'t they?\" \\n Emma is married to a university professor many years her senior. She is devastated by the news of the \"Building Site Baby\\' but why? She has no apparent ties to Angela\\'s family. Emma has had a difficult relationship with her mother Jude but it seems the two are trying to make peace with each other now that Emma is grown and married. But Emma has secrets of her own that will devastate everyone close to her when they are revealed. \\n The multiple points of view are executed brilliantly. Each narrator has their own unique voice and are each vital to the story. \\n \\'The Child\\' is an imaginative and surprising thriller. While the writing is filled with British slang and customs, that only added to my enjoyment of the story. \\n There are many twists and turns to this book and the ending was far more touching than I expected from what I though would be a suspense novel. The conclusion was enormously satisfying! Highly recommend this book for all thriller fans as well as anyone who loves a great story. \\n \"People say what doesn\\'t kill you makes you stronger. They say that when you been through something terrible ... But it doesn\\'t. It breaks your bones, leaving everything splintered and held together with grubby bandages and yellowing sticky tape.

       " '\"How did it come to this? How did we get here? How will it end?\" \\n What a perfect book to read during eclipse week 2017!! This taut and fast-paced thriller kept me on my toes until the very end. And what an ending! Kit and Laura are a young married couple who chase eclipses all over the world. It is an exciting, exotic lifestyle, hypnotic and mysterious all at once. \\n \"Then the darkness comes. Without the countdown in the sky, it\\'s pure and instant. All the street lights in the town below come on, so quickly it\\'s like sparks igniting. Now, in the darkness, disappointment is replaced by the familiar thrill of totality. But this time it\\'s different.\" \\n The book begins in 2015 with Laura\\'s point of view. She lives in London but she and her husband live anonymously. Why? The answer to that question unfolds slowly over the course of the book. We learn that Laura and Kit witnessed an violent assault during an eclipse festival years earlier and were witnesses for the prosecution during the trial of the attacker, Jamie. The trial was emotionally draining and physically exhausting for everyone and is described in minute detail. \\n The brutal assault is also described in vivid detail so I was curious as to how any doubt could arise about Jamie\\'s guilt or innocence. Just remember: there are many sides to each story. \\n \"The moment you think about an act in terms of how, you are already halfway to doing it.\" \\n We learn that Laura is now pregnant with twins but wants Kit to \"chase\" an upcoming eclipse while she stays behind in London, even though she is extremely paranoid about his travels. He has been an eclipse chaser since he was young and they both want to continue their adventures after their children are born. \\n They live in fear that Beth, the young woman who had been raped years before, will find them again. She had befriended them after the trial of her attacker, but then became wildly unstable. Laura and Kit became convinced they had to disappear \"off the grid\" so that she would never find them again. \\n This book was incredibly gripping and thought-provoking. It is told over the course of many years and features vivid characters and brilliantly-researched settings. The author forces the reader to confront their own morals and ask: What would you do in the same situation? \\n \"Until that day I\\'d been thinking about the campaign in binary terms: either Jamie was in denial, or he was calling the world\\'s bluff. But now a third possibility was inescapable, and one in which I was horrifically culpable. What if Jamie was innocent?\" \\n This book was addictive and wildly surprising. The references to eclipses are fascinating and the format of the book is divided into the parts of an eclipse. With my husband and daughter away \"eclipse chasing\" while I was reading this book, the subject matter was even more compelling! With themes of loyalty, guilt and devotion, this book really did it for me. I highly recommend this creative and thrilling story!',\n",
       " '\"Imagine a hospital where the structure itself becomes part of the healing process, or a home for dementia sufferers that actually helps them to remember. This house might be simple, but it\\'s ambition is extraordinary.\" \\n A fantastic psychological thriller that I could not put down!! Would you be willing to give up almost all of your worldly possessions for a chance live in a stunning home for very little rent? That is the fascinating premise of this book by JP Delaney, a pseudonym for a well-known writer. I read that the author did not want to reveal his/her gender because the book is told from a female point of view. I did not know this when I first read a sample, and the author succeeded in making me feel as though I was inside the narrators\\' minds. \\n The brilliant architect Edward Monkford has designed One Folgate Street in London, a high-tech house with cutting edge design. Edward is a follower of minimalism to the extreme, so much so that the tenants must agree to abide by his extreme de-cluttering rules and regulations. But he sees his rules as so much more than control and firmly believes that a house really can change you from within. If you have to de-clutter your life, then you will begin to see what is truly important in life, and you will free your mind to become a better person. \\n Emma and Jane are both looking for a fresh start. They are required to fill out a stringent and lengthy application in order to pass on to the final level of approval, which is a very brief meeting with the owner and designer of One Folgate Street. The rent is low and the house is located in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood. \\n Edward is difficult, mysterious, brilliant, moody...but the chance to live in the magnificent home is so tempting, the women overlook all of this in order for a chance to live at One Folgate Street. The home is equipped with the latest high-tech gadgets, and the tenants must answer periodic questionnaires in order to continue living in the house. The evaluations test their ethics, their physical well-being and their state of mind and are quite literally crucial to continues living in the house. \\n \"That\\'s all anyone\\'s looking for really, isn\\'t it? Someone to take care of the mess inside our heads?\" \\n The descriptions of the home are absolutely enthralling. I am still thinking about this book weeks after finishing! The idea of extreme de-cluttering is very thought-provoking and is woven inextricably into this intriguing story. Is Edward as dangerous and unhinged as everyone seems to think he is? This is a classic tale where NOTHING is as it seems. I literally read this book over the course of 2 days and was shocked by the surprising conclusion. \\n The story is told from the point of view of Emma, who is seeking a safe neighborhood and a secure home after a recent break-in, and Jane, who has suffered a tragic loss and is seeking a new beginning. Their stories converge in a creative way and I loved how the author kept me guessing until the very last page. The house literally plays a central role in this book and to me is one of the main characters in this story. If you are looking for a thrilling read that will challenge you and your boundaries, then \"The Girl Before\\' is for you!! I LOVED it and highly recommend it for all fans of domestic thrillers. \\n (Copy provided by the publisher via NetGalley.)',\n",

The rather abrupt ending was a little unsatisfying BUT the clever story kept me guessing. \\n I think most people do something or fail to take action that may cause some guilt. Well this story begins with Cass taking a shortcut late at night and failing to stop and help a woman who is stopped on the side of the road. \\n The motorist ends up dead. Cass feels guilty, but just as significant are the little things she begins to forget...how to run the washing machine, making dinner plans with friends, and even rather significant purchases. Her mother suffered from early-onset Alzheimer\\'s. What is happening to Cass? \\n Cass\\'s mental well-being soon spirals out of control and she fears she will suffer the same fate as her mother. \\n I literally could not put this book down! I FELT Cass\\'s hysteria and fear. The last part of the book was thrilling and surprising and gave me everything I love about thrillers. I highly recommend this one for all fans of this genre and even if you want to step outside your usual genre. Cass was a memorable heroine and I was cheering for her all throughout the book.

She begins to chafe in her perfect little bubble. \\n \"I can prepare dinner and I have on occasion, but he always insists we ask Penny, which irritates me. I have all day in this echoing apartment, my own voice bouncing off the sterile, bare walls and marble floors. Sometimes I wonder if uselessness can kill a person.\" \\n Zoe is witty, sarcastic and smart, and all of the characters were engaging and interesting. I loved her connection with Henry, and even though she was in love with him, she never quite felt that she really \"knew\" him at all. \\n \"Henry is a product of a traditional household and paternalism runs deep in his veins, which I find both charming and a little infuriating, depending on the day.\" \\n But is Zoe just imagining things where they do not exist? Henry is the perfect husband and all he wants to do is please her. The author did a great job at creating characters I really cared about. With all his odd mannerisms, Henry seems to be in love with his wife and do everything for her. After a charity event, Zoe begins to question her past and seeks out certain people that she had thought were long gone from her life. I don\\'t want to give anything away because this book is full of surprises and fantastic twists and turns. I absolutely loved Zoe\\'s slow awakening from a bored housewife to a woman with a purpose. The author kept me guessing for the whole book! \\n \\'The Vanishing Year\\' has been called a \"domestic thriller\". This is a perfect description. It is an edgy, sexy, exciting story that kept me guessing until the very end.

I can\\'t wait to read more books by the amazing Kate Moretti. \\n Favorite quote: \\n \"It wasn\\'t that long ago that I found this sort of convenient arrangement of our lives to be charming, like a party card trick. A sleight of hand here, a simple misdirection there, and Voila, here\\'s your dinner.

       " 'Filled with biting wit and sharp observation, \\'Evelyn, After\\' tells the story of one woman\\'s struggle to come to terms with her once picture-perfect life. Alternating before and after a tragic accident, this book poses complex questions which are not always easily answered. \\n As I read this compelling story, I found myself asking, \"What would I do if this happened to me?\" At first, I thought the answer was clear. But as Evelyn\\'s journey reveals, we don\\'t always do what\\'s right. People can be selfish and self-centered. The world can sometimes be a gray place. \\n Evelyn is the perfect wife and mother, devoted to her distant husband and her busy teenage son. But she has hidden her real self away for years, trying to be everything to everyone. She tries to please everyone but doesn\\'t even realize it. The author has a very keen eye for suburban life: \\n \"Her real purse was shoved under the passenger seat, stuffed full of receipts and Kleenex and hand sanitizer and Band-Aids and cough drops and an emergency flashlight and anything else that any person in the world might need from her while she was near. An eternal diaper bag for the eternal mother.\" \\n Of course this is a thriller and not everything is at it seems on the surface. Evelyn flip-flops between acting on what she has witnessed and letting everything go back to way it was \"before.\" \\n Evelyn had been so sure just a few minutes ago. Gary had to turn this woman in. He had to tell the truth. It was the only way to put this behind them and start over. Now she didn\\'t know anything. \\n Even though Evelyn does not behave in the most admirable way in the beginning of this story, I felt strongly sympathetic towards her and I found myself saying \"Yes! YES!\" to her during the course of this very readable book. Yes, there is cheating in this story, so if that is a hard limit for you, look away! But that theme was an integral part of this book and vital to Evelyn\\'s growth. \\n She\\'d spent her whole life doing the right thing. That could be someone else\\'s job now. She was moving on. \\n I could not put this book down! The synopsis intrigued me. And I loved the complete metamorphosis that Evelyn experienced. This book was at times tragic, funny, sexy and sarcastic. The author\\'s musings on marriage were sharp and unwavering \\n Jesus, how had she become this? Her life had been deep and rich and complex once. She\\'d lived with her single mother and her older sister, and they\\'d been strong, resilient, quick. She\\'d taken city buses and negotiated dangerous neighborhoods even as a child, and she\\'d imagined herself growing into an artist with wild, creative friends who had little money but so much heart. \\n This was real page-turner, a mature story with mature themes and situations. I loved it!! The conclusion surprised me and was perfectly satisfying. Highly recommend! \\n From now on, if something was important to her, she would demand it. Because the truth was that she belonged anywhere she wanted to be, and she was beautiful just for being brave.',\n",

The romance felt completely honest, down-to-earth and very \"true\". \\n Jayne Ann Krentz is a new author to me so I very much enjoyed getting to know her writing style. She has legions of fans and I can see why. I adored Max, who is a man of few words but knows how to get the job done. He has a very painful past so his lovely romance with Charlotte seems all the more sweeter. Charlotte is a no-nonsense heroine, who finds herself working in a retirement home after making some big life changes. \\n Charlotte\\'s step-sister Jocelyn is traveling to a retreat.

This is a quick, super-intriguing and twisty story that you can read in one day. I absolutely loved Max Cutler, with his smart, strong, quiet ways. He is my kind of hero! The romance is a quiet one but it fits perfectly with this story. There is tons of action and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time I was reading this book. \\n Jayne Ann Krantz is a skilled writer and Max and Charlotte\\'s story grabbed me from the very first page. There are lots of surprises in this one with some humor thrown in for good measure. Charlotte and Max are a little awkward, very lonely and absolutely perfect together! If you love a good mystery with a little romance and a smart and \"spunky\" heroine, then you\\'ll love \\'When All the Girls Have Gone.\\' There are several characters\\' POV\\'s in this book which kept me on my toes.

The only one who seems to really care about her is her captor. \\n Lots of readers didn\\'t like the jumping back and forth in time in the narration but I felt it added a sense of disorientation which was necessary in the book. All in all, a sturdy thriller hat kept me turning the pages all night. I cannot believe \\'The Good Girl\\' is the first book by Mary Kubica! I cannot wait to read her other books!',\n",
       " '4.5 Stars!! \\n One of Alessandra Torre\\'s best books. Couldn\\'t put it down!! Crisp, concise, fast-paced and enthralling. All of the ingredients for a great read! \\n \"If you lie enough times, no one believes your truth.\" \\n This book is Alessandra Torre at her best: no-nonsense, smart and engaging fiction. Helena is a very unlikely heroine, prickly, moody and basically angry at the world. She doesn\\'t want to rely on anyone at all. She even keeps her long-time agent Kate at arm\\'s length. \\n \"On rare days, Kate regrets ever meeting the woman. But on most days, she just wonders about her. They say all geniuses are a little mad. Maybe Helena\\'s madness just took longer to come out.\" \\n But Helena as a story to tell and she doesn\\'t have much time to do it. She sets her sights on one writer, and one writer only, to become her ghostwriter. A competing romance author, Marka writes books that Helena actually despises. But she sees a talent there that would be perfect for her own story. \\n \"What\\'s happened to me? I have a story that I don\\'t have time to tell. I have an empty house that reeks of death. I have no friends, no family, and no one to ask for help. I\\'m dying, and it\\'s the best thing that has happened to me in a long time.\" \\n Alessandra Torre builds the suspense perfectly in this book, all while holding the reader\\'s attention and slowly revealing the terrible secret about Helena\\'s life. This book is also a fascinating glimpse into the lonely life of a writer and the almost obsessive need to get the words out at all costs. \\n \"You can tell them who you are, or what your job in the book was. I don\\'t mind if they know I\\'ve had help.\" \\n They. The gods in their world, the eyes on which the axis rotated. The readers. The critics. What would they think? \\n This is most definitely not a romance but the main characters are both renowned romance writers. Helena\\'s own story begins as a romance but you just know it is NOT going to conclude with a happily ever after. \\n \"Boys like him don\\'t go for girls like me, they don\\'t follow me with their eyes, or listen when I speak. They don\\'t lean closer or want more.\" \\n I absolutely loved this book. Once I started I could not put it down. I applaud the author for creating a heroine who is far from loveable yet completely and utterly captivating. No question that astute readers will figure out the terrible secret before the surprising conclusion, but this book is a total winner nonetheless. It is completely original and inventive. I have never read anything like it. Alessandra Torre deserves all the accolades for this one! \\n \"Soon ... my final story will come out, and everyone will know the truth. \\n (Reviewed from an ARC obtained from NetGalley.)',\n",
       " 'Mind-bending and completely unique, take a chance and read this book!! This fast-paced, twisty science-fiction thriller was just what I needed to get out of a reading slump! Even if you don\\'t usually read this genre, DON\\'T MISS DARK MATTER! It is a brilliant romantic suspense story that had me guessing until the very end. \\n There IS a romance at the heart of this story of scientist/professor Jason Dessen, because to me, the struggle to get back to his beloved wife is what drives most of the action in this book. I went back and re-read the first chapter of this book after I finished to get a better picture of the sudden and violent kidnapping that occurs at the very beginning of this book. \\n \"My life is great. It\\'s just not exceptional. And there was a time when it could have been.\" \\n \"You killed your ambition, didn\\'t you?\" \\n \"It died of natural causes. Of neglect.\" \\n Jason is literally snatched from his current life and ends up in a place that might be a dream. He can\\'t tell the difference between real-life and fantasy, until it slowly starts to dawn on him what is really happening to him. The author made me feel sad, nostalgic and thrilled all at once. Plus there is an ethical dilemma at the heart of this story. \\n \"I feel insanity stalking me again, threatening to curl me up fetal and shatter me into a million pieces.\" \\n Dark Matter is best read without knowing any spoilers. AND I was thrilled to learn that it is going to be made into a movie!! YES!! Paging Viggo Mortensen or Michael Fassbender! This story literally had me on the edge of seat the entire time I was reading. Just when I thought I had things figured out, I was surprised and thrilled by the next turn of events. Part philosophy about what might have been, part romance, and all suspense, Dark Matter is a book I won\\'t soon forget. \\n \"It\\'s the beautiful thing about youth. \\n There\\'s a weightlessness that permeates everything because no damning choices have been made, no paths committed to, and the road forking out ahead is pure, unlimited potential.\" \\n (With thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for a review copy.)',\n",
       " '\"Cheers,\" she says, raising her tumbler. \"To remembering.\" \\n Frank clinks his glass against hers and he smiles. \"And to you,\" he says. \"For being so generous.\" \\n \"Oh,\" she says. \"I don\\'t know about generous. Stupid more like.\" \\n \"Maybe both,\" he says. \\n \"Yeah. I\\'ll go with that. Story of my life. Generous and stupid.\" \\n OMG!!! I did not want this book to end!! What a page-turner. Moody, evocative and thrilling, Lisa Jewell\\'s writing surprised and enthralled me from beginning to end. \\n This book begins with Alice, a frazzled single mother living in a tiny seaside town in England, finding a man, lost and alone and with no memory of how he came to be sitting on the beach in the driving rain. \\n Alice is funny, warm, witty and has not made the best choices in her life. In fact, her love life stinks so she is very wary of men in general. But something calls to her about this lost and confused man, and she brings him back to her cottage to recuperate in her guest house. \\n \"How long have you been sitting out here?\" \\n \"I got here yesterday.\" \\n \"Where did you come from?\" \\n \"I have no idea.\" \\n This brilliant story is told from multiple POV\\'s spanning several decades. At the same time that Alice finds \"Frank\" (her nickname for the seemingly lovely man struggling with his memory loss), a young bride in London named Lily realizes her new husband has suddenly vanished. She is new to England and does not know anyone at all. The mystery of her missing newlywed husband is one of the driving forces of this gem of a book. \\n There are tons of twists and surprises in store for the reader. We do not know how the characters in this story are connected... or even if they are connected at all. \\n Flashing back decades before, young Gray and Kirsty are on holiday with their parents. Their fascinating story involves a local man who becomes interested in Kirsty. Their stories rocket towards a stunning conclusion with Alice, Frank and Lily. To say that I could not put this book down is an understatement! From the bustling London setting to the small seaside resort town, \\'I Found You\\' sets the bar for romantic suspense books this year. \\n Long after finishing this book, I still can\\'t stop thinking about the characters. Lisa Jewell is a new favorite author of mine. This was my first book by her and now I cannot wait to get to her other titles. Alice was completely relatable, even when she didn\\'t make the wisest of choices. \\n I can\\'t recommend this book highly enough! I loved every word. \\n ARC provided via NetGalley.',\n",
       " '\"We plead biological necessity when caught straying. But that\\'s often just a convenient rationalization to explain away a moment of moral failure-- of weakness. We can control ourselves.\" \\n UNDONE is a weird, wild, thought-provoking and very witty story. It is part erotic thriller, part suspense and all satire. I finished this book a few weeks ago and had to think about the story for a while. This is a very risky book that is certainly not for everyone but is a fascinating commentary on society\\'s obsession with celebrity and fame. UNDONE centers around Dez, a dangerous predator who is living with his former student, Chloe. Dez has a sick obsession with teenage girls, but totally rationalizes his unhealthy attraction and blames everyone else for his problems. He is smart but very, very troubled and borders on sociopathic. He ha convinced himself that his relationship with the teenage Chloe is almost normal. \\n \"But on a deeper level, shielded, hidden, he recognized some profound connection between them. He felt an almost frightening reliance on her, an emotional dependence. The feeling was unprecedented for him and brought him a form of happiness.\" \\n Dez becomes obsessed with Jasper, a famous author who has written a best-selling book about his family. Dez creates a diabolical scheme to destroy Jasper, enlisting the gullible Chloe in his plan. So begins a suspenseful story that literally rockets along to a stunning conclusion, filled with biting commentary, completely inappropriate characters and very, very taboo subjects. \\n There is no question that John Colapinto is a brilliant writer and his prose and plot are flawless. BUT this book is NOT for the faint of heart or anyone who is offended by forbidden subjects! If you are looking for a standard romantic suspense novel, move along, because UNDONE is not for you. But if you love to read something different, incredibly creative and very challenging, then this is the book for you. Kudos to John Colapinto for tackling some very dangerous themes in an incredibly creative way. I found UNDONE to be enormously readable and I encourage anyone who loves something different to give this book a try. \\n On another note, I find it incredible that the author received over 40 rejection letters for this book! It is in no way the most taboo book I have ever read and I am glad that the publisher gave this book a chance. \\n (Copy gifted by the author in return for an honest review.)',\n",
       " 'Well, then! A complete and total mindf*k!! The beginning of the book was a little disorientating but once I got past the first few chapters, I was rewarded with a very clever and twisty romantic suspense story. Very memorable characters and an interesting storyline. Not at all what I expected. \\n The book begins right in the middle of a very tense scene which I had to go back and re-read after finishing this book. At first I was very disoriented by the story and could not figure out where the author was going or what these characters were going to do. I was completely and totally taken aback by the direction this story took and raced though this book in one sitting! \\n This is one of those books that should be read without knowing too much about the plot. I did not know anything about this author or the story before reading and I was pleasantly surprised. PAPER DOLLS is suspenseful, thrilling, very surprising and has a very enthralling storyline. Kudos to Hanna Peach for creating an unforgettable cast of characters and bringing very important topics to light and treating the subject matter with great sensitivity and understanding. \\n Hanna Peach is an author to watch and I look forward to reading more books from this talented writer! \\n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)',\n",
       " \"Okay I don't even know where to start with this! If you want something addictive, then read this. Once I started, I couldn't put it down. This book is not a romance, but there is plenty of sex; and in a way, it is strangely romantic, because of the heroine's hopeful outlook on relationships and love. \\n This is the story of young Aimee, who arrives in New York City from Oklahoma to start a new life. She meets Danny, a very powerful, much older man who sweeps her off her feet. There are several other very intriguing characters who may or may not become important in later parts of this story. The synopsis hints at dark turns but the first part is not all that dark; gritty, yes, but no sadism (yet!) The writing is very fast-paced and kept me engaged. \\n The non-linear timeline of this book threw me off balance and kept me on the edge of my seat. It was a little disorienting but the real kicker is the ending! Or lack of one. I am very intrigued by this story and will definitely read the next installment.\",\n",
       " \"WOW!!! What a fascinating, twisty, surprising story!! I love KA Tucker's writing so I was very excited to read this one and it is VERY different from her other books. Adult, suspenseful, thrilling...with an ending that I never saw coming! This is one of those books that you will not put down until you are finished. It is told in flashbacks and in alternating POV's from Maggie and her best friend Celine's diary entries. Maggie does not believe her best friend committed suicide and begins investigating the circumstances surrounding Celine's death in New York City. She meets is all of the important people in Celine's life, including Jace, who may or may not be hiding something. There is also Grady, the very sexy building super, who is also under suspicion in Maggie's eyes. \\n I gingerly unfold the paper that's obviously been handled many times, judging by the crinkles in it. \\n My eyes widen. \\n A naked man fills one side. He's entrancingly handsome... lying on his back, one muscular arm disappearing into the pillow beneath his head, a white sheet tangled around his legs, not quite covering the goods... \\n Who the hell is this guy and why didn't I ever hear about him? And where is he now? Where were they together last? \\n Does he know that she's dead? \\n ... I slowly fold the paper back up. Celine's cursive scrawl decorates the back side in purple ink. Words I hadn't noticed before. \\n Words that make my heart stop now. \\n 'This man was once my salvation. Now he will be my ruin.' \\n Maggie and Celine were childhood friends but grew apart once they got older. Maggie learns many things about Celine's life through reading her diaries and is convinced that the diaries will be the key to learning about her death. He Will Be my Ruin is a tightly written, taught suspense thriller that has a completely resolved ending and a smart, resourceful heroine. There's plenty of twists and turns to satisfy even the most jaded mystery reader. I loved this book and hope that KA Tucker writes more suspense in the future!! \\n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)\",\n",
       " 'Absolutely astounding!!!! And the end was perfection. \\n HIDDEN BODIES begins where where YOU ended. For those of you who do not like cliffies, YOU wasn\\'t really a cliffhanger and can absolutely be read as a standalone. However, for someone like me who is obsessed with Joe Goldberg (and a little bit in love with him? Weird, I know), I was thrilled that there was more to this story. \\n As funny as the author\\'s commentary on NYC life was, she is even funnier and more on-point with her look at living in L.A. Don\\'t fear, Joe is still as crazy as ever, but in an almost \"Being There\" fashion, everyone around him seems to mold him into what they believe him to be. \\n And Joe is trying. He really is. But is still a complete and total sociopath. Despite that, I was really rooting for him to find true love in HIDDEN BODIES. But everyone is just so phony and materialistic and so Joe really believes he is justified in his actions. This story is just as addictive and readable as YOU, and will keep you on the edge of your seat, terrified but yet laughing out loud. Scary, funny, heartbreaking and amazing.

       " '4.5 Sexy, Gritty Stars!! \\n Karina Halle never ceases to amaze with her writing! She can take a reader from swoony, sexy contemporary romance, to stories like Dirty Promises, a brutal, rough, gritty and violent story that is incredibly gripping, sexy and readable. \\n Javier Bernal is a cruel man. Yet I still felt sympathy for him (it\\'s true!) because if you have taken the journey with this character, you will know he is the product of his history and background. But make no mistake, this book is violent and is set in the world of drug cartels. If you are looking for a different read, with fantastic writing, then I highly recommend this series. \\n Javier and Luisa have a marriage that is on the brink of falling apart. Their story here is an incredibly wild ride and is most definitely NOT for the faint of heart. But if you are willing to take a risk with your reading, then you will be immensely rewarded. I did not know what to expect with DIRTY PROMISES because I knew this would be a gritty story, maybe even more so than the other books in this series. Karina Halle really delivers the goods with this book and if you are a fan of dark, action-packed stories with a very damaged \"hero\", then please read this series. The books and the characters are unforgettable!! \\n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)',\n",
       " '\"My mother used to tell me that I had an overactive imagination...\" \\n And with that, Rachel the narrator certainly becomes one of the most unreliable narrators I\\'ve ever had the pleasure of reading. There are actually several points of view in \\'The Girl on the Train\\' but Rachel is the main narrator. A sad sack of a woman, she has been recently divorced, fired from her job in London and is losing a nasty battle with the bottle. Because she is often drunk, nothing she says or recalls is trustworthy. \\n I needed a break from my usual contemporary romances and this thriller kept me glued to my Kindle! Rachel sees a \"perfect couple\" from the train every day, and she concocts an elaborate fantasy life for them. Surely they must lead a perfect life! Unlike her, they seem to live a charmed life, sitting in their pretty garden every day, sipping coffee together. \\n \"I don\\'t know their names, either, so I had to name them myself. Jason, because he\\'s handsome in a British film star kind of way, not a Depp or a Pitt, but a Firth, or a Jason Isaacs. And Jess just goes with Jason, and it goes with her. It fits her, pretty and carefree as she is. They\\'re a match, they\\'re a set. They\\'re happy, I can tell. They\\'re what I used to be, they\\'re Tom and me five years ago. They\\'re what I lost, they\\'re everything I want to be. \\n Slowly we realize that in fact NOTHING in this book is as it seems, and Rachel is soon drawn into a frightening situation about which, sadly for her, she has no memory. On top of everything else, Rachel is constantly morose and sad, depressed about the loss of her beloved husband Tom, and begins to drive everyone away who ever cared about her. \\n \"Beautiful sunshine, cloudless skies, no one to play with, nothing to do. Living like this, the way I\\'m living at the moment, is harder in the summer when there is so much daylight, so little cover of darkness, when everyone is out and about, being flagrantly, aggressively happy. It\\'s exhausting, and it makes you feel bad if you\\'re not joining in. \\n Rachel drinks so much that she begins to black out. She stalks her ex-husband and his new wife Anna but just can\\'t seem to stop herself. \\n \"I have lost control over everything, even the places in my head.\" \\n This book takes many twists and turns and nothing at all is at it seems. Just when I thought I knew where the story was going, it veered off into another place entirely. it is smart, perfectly paced and filled with flawed, all-too-human characters. Even though Rachel is COMPLETELY unlikable, I was cheering for her throughout the book. \\n \\'The Girl on the Train\\' is smart, clever and surprising. Glad I read it before the movie came out.

But don\\'t even ask where he got the nickname of Tooth! \\n Although this is the second book in a series, the books can be read as standalones. In The Devil\\'s Ride, Tooth is ordered to protect the Club President\\'s son and at first, it is a painful, unwanted chore. Luci is a brat and very out of the closet, very different than Tooth. But he is crazy about Tooth, even if a little scared of him, and even acts out so that Tooth will \"punish\" him. Although I absolutely adored the smexy times between these two, and they are SCORCHING HOT, I also loved the gritty and very violent look inside MC life. This is not a sugar-coated story at all. I loved the underlying story about a crime the MC is trying to solve. (Not for the faint of heart!) \\n I absolutely adored the slow-burn of Tooth and Luci\\'s relationship. It made their love scenes together all the sweeter. And did I mention that K.A. Merikan can write some of the most erotic sex scenes out there?

I love dark reads and this sounded exactly like a story I would love. Remember if you are looking for a book about love and romance, this is not the story for you. Deanna is a sex \"web cam\" girl but is also a virgin. She locks herself away in her apartment with virtually no human interaction beyond her online interactions because she battles homicidal tendencies. She has her neighbor actually lock her in her own apartment at night so that she won\\'t be able to give in to her urges. \\n A deliveryman becomes fascinated with this beautiful and strange girl who won\\'t even open the door to retrieve her packages and Deanna and Jeremy begin a very strange but exciting relationship. Just when I though this book was going a certain way, it changed course and went down a completely different path. I was shocked, thrilled, fascinated and blown away by the ending of this book. \\n \"No one is normal. Everyone is just pretending to be normal.\" \\n I absolutely loved how this story unfolded layer by layer. I was immediately pulled into this incredible story, and was fascinated by all of the characters, by some of their very dark natures, and by the interactions and internal dialogue that goes on inside Deanna\\'s head. The setting and the thrilling storyline that unfolds stunned me and I felt compelled to know more.This book is a must-read, especially for fans of dark stories. There is plenty of sex, and even a little romance thrown in, but it is the shock and surprise at the characters and the story that make this an unforgettable book. \\n I want to thank the author for not only making unsympathetic characters believable, but for also writing this book that I will never forget. \\n (*Copy provided by the author for an honest review.)',\n",

If you are looking for a dark, smart and erotic story, then DO NOT DISTURB is the book for you. \\n This book is the sequel to THE GIRL IN 6E, a fantastic and surprising story which I recommend that you read immediately!! The author continues the story of Deanna in DO NOT DISTURB and her story is intertwined with another character who might, just might, be as dark and disturbed as she is. But where Deanna tries her best to keep her dark nature hidden away and under control (barely), this new character does not. He is plain evil. The author has done a masterful job at building suspense and anticipation in this book and the plot twists are fantastic. This is a smart and twisted book and definitely NOT for the faint of heart. \\n Deanna is faced with danger here in the form of an unhappy client. Will he outsmart the brilliant Deanna and pierce the layers of protection she has built of around her? Will Deanna finally find some semblance of normalcy with the sexy and understanding Jeremy? Once again, the author writes a brilliant story that answers all these questions without talking down to the reader and without coming to any false conclusions. The tensions are high and the sexy times are brilliantly erotic. I haven\\'t stopped thinking about these characters! I amy dying (well, not literally) for another book in this series!!

       " \"4.5 stars!! \\n What can I say about Tarryn Fisher other than she is one of my favorite writers? Her style is powerful, clean, bold and unapologetic. Mud Vein is no exception. Senna and Isaac's story is not what you think, and not at all what you would you expect. This book totally took me off guard because I didn't read any reviews with spoilers in them. Like her earlier books (The Love Me with Lies series), this story is brutally honest, and is not a hearts-and-flowers, sugary-sweet romance. \\n The plot is incredibly inventive and different, and stunning as well. I fell in love with Isaac and by the end of the book, also really cared about Senna even though as with other characters written by Ms. Fisher, she is a prickly sort. I did not see the ending of this book coming, and it is really best if you don't know the ending as well. Mud Vein is another incredibly written book by Tarryn Fisher. She poured her heart and soul into this book and it really shows. I highly recommend Mud Vein. You won't soon forget it.\",\n",
       " \"I enjoyed the latest book in the Cut & Run series. With that being said, there is an awful lot going on in this book, and the focus is not totally on Ty and Zane but is also shared by Nick and Kelly. \\n The story takes our group to Scotland for a wedding celebration. Much mystery occurs with lots of action. Of course my favorite parts of the book are the hot sexy times between Ty and Zane and the sometimes humorous banter between them. Abigail Roux writes some deliciously steamy scenes and I wanted more, more, more! All of the characters are well-developed and it seems like the focus might be on Nick and Kelly later. \\n If you like a lot of fast-paced action, a good mystery and some really, really hot Alpha guys, then you will love Ball & Chain. I absolutely love Abigail Roux's wriritng style and look forward to reading many more of her books. \\n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)\",\n",

       " '\"Break Her\" is one of those books that I am really not qualified to \"review\" because the writing is so amazing (Clue #1 as to the author\\'s identity!) so I\\'ll just stick to giving my humble opinion. \\n I read this book a few months ago and have been thinking about it ever since. To me, that is the hallmark of an excellent book. Here is the synopsis of the story, in which a woman wakes to find a dangerous stranger in her bed: \\n \"Now your home has become your prison, and your body, a battlefield. How would you hold onto your sanity, your self-esteem, your very soul against someone determined to annihilate all three? \\n In the psychological thriller Break Her, one woman will find herself in this almost unthinkable situation, and one man will discover that he has finally come up against someone unlike any of those he has destroyed before. \\n On the surface, this intruder has all the advantages: strength, weapons, ruthlessness. The only way he can lose is if he finds himself responding to his victim on a human level. The only way she can win is if she rips away the protective lies she\\'s told herself, the hard shell of indifference she\\'s hidden in, and becomes again what she has not been since she lost everything that mattered to her, years ago. \" \\n Break Her is a very graphic story of the gripping psychological interplay between the woman and the rapist. (I refuse to call her simply \"Victim\" as some reviewers have done.) The rapist is very cunning and very strong. He is determined to destroy the woman not only physically, but emotionally as well. \\n \"He was decent looking. He probably had money. He could have sex any way he wanted any time he wanted. But he liked it this way.\" \\n The story itself is set over a period of an excruciating day and a half, within the physical confines of a house. The characters are not named by the author. Through a series of flashbacks, however, the woman\\'s past is explained in detail and other characters are introduced. I was hanging on every word, and reading furiously to reach the stunning conclusion of this book. \\n \"You think you\\'ll wear me out,\" he hissed, not using a question. \"You think you\\'ll eventually satisfy me, and reach the end of this. But everything you do makes me want you more, deeper, impossibly more. I think I\\'m reaching a point I\\'ve never hit before. Like perpetual motion. Or nirvana. I\\'ll never stop.\" \\n There are many questions raised by this story. What was the author trying to convey here? Well, first and foremost, I think it is a story of the woman\\'s fierce strength and will to survive. The author has written this book under a pseudonym so that we do not know the writer\\'s gender. Brilliant. \\n The author has ventured an opinion on the subject of rape in other forums that forgiveness allows rape victims to move on, and to separate themselves from what happened. The author has also questioned why rape is the only crime that seems to be an \"open wound\", which gives men a huge amount of power to know that by this one act, they can potentially destroy a woman. Certainly the woman in \"Break Her\" does not accept the definition of rape as an \"open wound\" and in that sense, this book is very empowering. \\n \"Break Her\" is an incredibly gripping and yes, emotionally exhausting, story. It is very thought-provoking and will make you question what values you believe in. I could not put this book down. I can only hope that the author chooses to continue the woman\\'s story because I need more of this story.Break HerB.G. Harlen',\n",

It pulls you into this quiet neighborhood and it's easy to imagine living there and being a part of it. But maybe that's just because I remember being young (quite a few years younger than the teens in the book) in a small town in the south in the early '90s. But the greatest part of the book is that even though the plot revolves around a violent crime, it's not what the book is about. The relationships crafted between the narrator and the women in his life are beautiful, unique and shape the world in which he exists. \\n I'm not sure what more I can say without going into greater specifics that I fear would give away too much of this book. All I can say is it's beautifully written, it pulls you in, and despite revolving around a violent crime, you're more focused on the relationships and the hope of healing of all the characters. It's not depressing, but instead makes you think about your own transition to adulthood and how things appear different now through a different perspective from youth and how the change of perspective shapes who you are as a person.\",\n",

I do believe I made a stronger connection to it having read the other books featuring her. My only complaint would be that Dugoni explains his cultural references. For example when the characters sit under a painting of Mick Jagger, it is immediately explained that he is the front man for the Rolling Stones. As a reader, if you're going to reference popular cultural, don't insult me by explaining it to me. Other than that minor irritant, a very good book.

       " 'I\\'ll start off by saying that I gave this 4 stars because I found it enjoyable to read and because this site doesn\\'t allow me to give it 3 1/2 and 3 seemed a bit harsh though maybe closer to the reality. That said, there are some problems with this book. The sentence structure is awkward in much of the book. OK, no one reads erotica for great literature but this could do with an editor who understands grammar and sentence structure. It\\'s not horrible but it\\'s awkward and that would be an easy fix. What happened to editors anyway? They don\\'t seem to exist anymore. \\n There was something that irked me at the beginning but thankfully it was never repeated. Pre-mortem. No. That is not a word. Postmortem. Antemortem. Perimortem. A cop should know this and I hope if the author does an edit of this book that he fixes that one, it\\'s right in the beginning and it really made me cringe. This is the trouble that I think any writer would encounter who doesn\\'t have the resources to speak directly with a police officer or homicide detective in order to research their book and keep it realistic. There are some problems here as well. The biggest one (and I promise to not give any spoilers) is how obvious the killer is and how determined Gavin is to ignore it. I mean, neon flashing sign, obvious. But Gavin doesn\\'t seem to have any cop instincts for a seasoned detective. This bothered me a lot and it made the book frustrating. That and well the whole set up because in the real world his insertion of himself into the case would really hinder any prosecution if/when an arrest was made. Due to his personal involvement with the club/people in the case, it would make any of his testimony highly suspect and would likely get him fired or at least busted down from detective. \\n Like I said, however, I really did enjoy this book. Gavin and Ben are extremely likeable characters (even if Gavin does come across as a bit of a dummy). I really enjoyed Gavin\\'s family and especially his brother Cole. AJ Rose has done a lot of things right here and it makes up for the problems even if I was yelling \"Why are you being so stupid?!\" at the book at one point. But I wanted to keep reading and that\\'s the key and that\\'s why I gave this 4 stars. I wanted to know how it would end. I wanted to cheer Ben and Gavin on in their relationship. I think AJ Rose has done a wonderful job with that part of the book and with opening the door to the BDSM world for any readers who may be unfamiliar with it. \\n The sex scenes are explicit and steamy (and let\\'s be honest, that\\'s why you\\'re considering reading this book). The awkward sentence structure is not a deterrent but the not very good at his job detective might be. If you\\'re a fan of this genre and want a quick and easy read and are willing to suspend your disbelief that Gavin is any kind of cop, give it a shot. If you\\'re looking for substance and literature or a good crime story, maybe give this one a miss. \\n Warning, for those who may require it, there are some non-consensual violent acts in this book. You\\'re reading an erotic story but it\\'s also a crime story and you should keep that in mind. Also, of course, contains elements of BDSM. Why are you even considering reading a book with a photo of a guy tied up on the cover if you\\'re bothered by kink? ;)',\n",

I\\'d figured out the \"who done it\" almost immediately but given that I usually do, that wasn\\'t such a big deal. \\n I would have loved to have the relationship between the protagonist and the antagonist explored further but I see this is a #1 so I\\'m anxious to read the next in the series and see if it continues and maybe gets a little more detailed.

       " \"Although Joe Hill dedicated this novel to his mother, it's really just a big fat wonderful ode to his father. \\n Everything that King does wonderfully -- storytelling, plotting, pacing -- Hill gets right, and so much more. This book is carefully and perfectly paced, and Hill's characterization (of every character) is thoughtful and consistent. It feels folksy and New England-y like Stephen King's best work, but it never feels like it needs an editor (which I feel some of King's later work really does...). Hill has poured so much care and attention into this book; and I guess it doesn't really matter who it is or should be dedicated to. It's just a great story. \\n Kate Mulgrew does an excellent narration, too. She is pure Americana, rough and raspy, and a great hero and even better villain. Also, the audiobook has a really nice afterword by Hill himself, where he talks about the writing of this book and about audiobooks, and he gives some audio recommendations.\",\n",
       " \"** spoiler alert ** \\n Although I liked this book, I think there are problems. Pedophilia, rape, and incest are weighty topics, but Abbott glosses over them in favor of writing the story in a thriller-esque style. Don't get me wrong: I like this style and I like Abbott's writing; but I wanted this story told with more significance, more thought. \\n It might be a problem with the narrator, who is a child herself (an adolescent, 13/14 year old), but it's still a problem.\",\n",
       " \"I'd recommend this literary thriller for anyone who read and enjoyed Paula Hawkins's The Girl on the Train. \\n Barr tells a strong story and uses multiple first person perfectly to slow down the pace when necessary to build tension and to keep little mysterious morsels hidden until they need to come out. \\n But my favorite part of this story is that the women aren't rescued by the men, and the relationship among the three women is paramount. \\n Imogen Church does an excellent job narrating this; the way she differentiates Lara and Iris is subtle and perfectly done.\",\n",

Malerman didn't spend enough time with Malorie and the children once they reached their destination, and I wanted the whole thing to be more developed, start to finish. \\n I enjoyed the narrator, Cassandra Campbell, when she read Orange is the New Black, but I didn't like her reading of this. All of the women sounded overly emotional and that made them come off as weak and kind of shrieky. I don't know how much direction the author gives, so this effect might not have been Campbell's choice; but I still didn't like it.\",\n",
       " \"Ware has written a pretty good atmospheric thriller. The setting--a modern glass house in the middle of (wait for it) a dark, dark wood--works nicely to increase tension and isolate our characters. \\n I have some issues with her characters, though. Frequently, Nora's actions and internal justifications (p.o.v. is Nora's first person) feel false, unbelievable, and sometimes contradictory. And I wanted more development of Clare. Ware does use the first person smartly, though, when she's withholding information about Nora and Clare's conflict and personal history. \\n A note on the audiobook: Imogen Church is a terrific narrator and I plan to look for other work she's read.\",\n",

       " 'Haynes ramps up the standard police procedural with official documents -- witness statements, interviews, and analyst\\'s phone charts. Now, does that sound interesting to you? If you\\'re a nerd like me, it might. \\n Haynes, who works (or worked) as a police analyst inserts documents from the case, Operation Nettle, as a way of giving exposition without having to write scenes with characters unrelated to the main action of the story. And it works well. The documents are all short but fun peeks into \"official\" police business. \\n The story itself is interesting and fast-moving, although I wish Haynes would settle down with these romances she builds into her books. I had the same reaction to what I felt was a totally unnecessary romantic/sexual relationship with the protagonist in Dark Tide; this book has another one with DCI Louisa Smith and the analyst, Jason. I like some nice sexual tension, but it felt unnecessary and demeaned her as a strong female lead, which I really wanted her to be.',\n",
       " \"Although I enjoyed this book (it's a good bet I'll enjoy anything Hayder has written), it didn't grab me like some of her others have. Possibly that's because it felt a little slow to me; I didn't fall completely into it until I was two-thirds through. Or possibly it's because I wanted more of something -- more development of Oaksey, or of his wife, Lexie, or more time spent on the island with the villagers. Something. \\n What Hayder does get right, as usual, is her narrative structure. Pig Island alternates first person diary/letter-style narratives, one from Oaksey and the second from Lexie (most in the form of letters to her therapist, which are abnormally detailed [including dialogue] than a letter one might write to her therapist, but, whatever, it's a thriller, I don't care). I loved this alternating p.o.v. and it was an interesting way to slow down the pace when the story called for it. \\n If you read Hayder's Hanging Hill and enjoyed the ending (and maybe yelled at the book at little bit), then read Pig Island. And if you finish Pig Island and really like the ending, read Hanging Hill\",\n",

The interviews take place after the \"incident\", and our third person begins quite a bit earlier, when the story\\'s conflict started to emerge. It\\'s a great technique to escalate tension and interest quickly. \\n And I love our characters, especially Madeline. She\\'s the woman you\\'d kill to be friends with, to drink wine with, to crab about your troubles with. She is a great friend to Jane and Celeste, and she\\'s a great character. \\n Caroline Lee is a terrific narrator, and she\\'s made me fall in love with the Australian accent.

Abbott gives us compelling and realistic teenage characters as well as likable and complex adults; she gives us atmosphere and complexity; she gives us hints and leads that are not overly complex but just enough to keep us turning pages to find out the real answer. \\n I stayed up way past my bedtime to finish this.

It\\'s an enjoyable, well-written adventure and I\\'ll definitely read A Winter Haunting and Children of the Night, which feature our characters all grown up.',\n",
       " \"This is a such an icky, terrifying book. Hayder is a master of pace: she cuts around to different characters and sub-plots, all seeming to happen simultaneously, and I couldn't seem to consume them all fast enough. And they're all scary. Really scary. \\n Although this wasn't as...visceral as Birdman, it's harder to read because of the content: the criminals aren't just killers, but child abusers, pedophiles, and child pornographers. It's a tough story, but if you can get through that, it's a great, gruesome thriller.\",\n",
       " \"Although this is a major page turner, it's got some issues. Haynes structures this book similarly to her book Into the Darkest Corner: she alternates between our protagonist's back story and the present until we finally get the whole picture at the story's climax and denouement. It's a great structure to quicken the pace and keep the reader (at least this reader) staying up way past her bedtime to finish the book. \\n My problem was with the sexual relationship between our main character and the police detective; it wasn't necessary and just distracted me. Some of the story is clunky, and some is unbelievable. But on the whole, it's a fast read and a good slice of brain-candy thriller.\",\n",

That's right: Dalgliesh. I just couldn't escape him and it irritated me to no end. \\n This story featured a young woman who is the new proprietor of a private investigation agency. She gets a case that leads her to Cambridge, where she ambles around for a couple hundred pages. It's an odd story and I felt that it was overly complicated and wrapped up too quickly; however, if you're a fan of James and don't mind Dalgliesh, you'll probably enjoy it more than I did.\",\n",

But Knoll includes it among other plot points and it doesn't get the time and space that a conflict of that magnitude really deserves. \\n And there were too many smaller pieces of Ani's story that were left untouched. I wanted this to be more focused to get a stronger sense of her change from beginning to end. It just wasn't strong enough for me. \\n Knoll is a strong writer, though, and this is definitely a page turner.

I wanted them to survive--even Jonno (sort of), who is the world's biggest douchebag--and I yelled at them when they were doing things that endangered their lives. And because this is a horror/thriller, that happened a lot. \\n This was realistically gruesome--a bit of a police procedural, which I love--but supernatural as well, which pushed it over the edge into truly nightmarish. \\n I'm not from Detroit, so my friends from MI might disagree, but I like what Beukes does with the city. It feels authentic, palpable. \\n I'm not usually a fan of audiobooks with multiple narrators, but because the narrative voices are so distinct, it worked well. And the reader for Jonno, Sunil Mohatra, sounds like a grade-A jackass, which is perfect. Although it's also totally irritating. Because I want to punch Jonno in the face.\",\n",
       " '** spoiler alert ** \\n This is a solid, tense thriller from Elizabeth Haynes. \\n Haynes gives us alternating first-person accounts from Cathy Bailey on two sides of a horrifying domestic attack from her boyfriend, Lee. One side of the story begins in 2003, when Cathy first meets Lee and they begin to date. It becomes increasingly tense and violent and ends with Lee beating Cathy within an inch of her life and leaving her for dead. \\n The other side of the narrative takes up Cathy\\'s story about three years later: Lee has been in prison, Cathy has moved to London to disappear, and she has been dealing with the mental trauma--PTSD and OCD--of surviving such an attack. \\n What Haynes does so beautifully is give us pieces from the \"past\" of Cathy\\'s story, as it move forward in time and the reader is more and more terrified along with our protagonist, alternated with pieces from the \"present\" of Cathy\\'s story, as she works on the skills to help her cope with the past and feel more in control. As the reader is on the edge of her seat leading up to the \"past\" climax, the current Cathy is getting better and better, which turns out to be necessary for Lee\\'s final attack. \\n The story isn\\'t so much about an abusive man as it is about a strong woman who is abandoned by her friends but continues to trust people and get the help she needs. It is a book written by a woman and never makes Cathy out to be pathetic for staying with Lee; she is never an idiot, nor is she unbelievable. She is a normal, smart, independent woman; she could be any of us, and that\\'s what makes it even scarier. \\n On a side note, I love Karen Cass as the narrator and will make a point to listen to more books read by her. She does a variety of male and female characters, English and Scottish, from different regions, and they\\'re all distinct and well done.',\n",
       " \"** spoiler alert ** \\n Haynes has written a solid story that's a kind of police-procedural/thriller mash-up. She plays with narrative, giving us alternating first-person points-of-view from Annabel and Colin as well as from some of Colin's victims (from beyond the grave), and peppering in newspaper reports tracking the investigation and profiling the deceased. She raises interesting questions about what constitutes a crime but still gives us a solid, creepy villain. \\n Haynes isn't as literary a writer as Tana French, and she's not as graphic or pace-focused as Mo Hayder, but she's got some chops. Karen Cass does a great job narrating, and I liked the story and the listening experience enough that I've just downloaded Haynes's Into the Darkest Corner, also with Cass. I'll let you know!\",\n",

And, honestly, I prefer Broken Monsters. \\n I\\'m not sure if I prefer Broken Monsters because I wasn\\'t keen on the narration for The Shining Girls (Khristine Hvam reads Kirby, and she just sounds so overly sassy that it\\'s hard to like her), or if it was the overall story of Broken Monsters that I liked more. Clayton Broom (B.M.) is a more interesting killer than Harper Curtis (T.S.G.). Broom is haunted and not really in control; the \"art\" he creates is horrible and fascinating. Harper, on the other hand, is just a killer of women who happens to have a time traveling house at his disposal. Now, I have nothing against time traveling houses (way cool), but I just wasn\\'t as scared of or horrified by Harper as I was of Clayton. \\n I also really enjoyed that Broken Monsters has protagonists--Gabriella and Layla--who are women of color. It\\'s not something I see often in the horror or thriller genres, but it\\'s something I\\'d like to see more of. Additionally, the regular horror of what a group of teenage boys does to Layla\\'s friend Cass is almost as awful as the murders Clayton commits--it certainly had me yelling at the book. That adds something to Broken Monsters that The Shining Girls just doesn\\'t have. \\n I\\'d have liked The Shining Girls more if I\\'d read a hard copy. It\\'s still a good book--it\\'s an interesting bend on both the thriller and the horror story, and it takes place in Chicago, which is fun. But if you\\'re starting out with Beukes, I\\'d recommend Broken Monsters first.',\n",

Times, wrote an excellent piece about the watchfulness and Rear Window-ness of Hawkins's book--and her review will be 1,000 times better than anything I can write, so you should read it. \\n And then read The Girl on the Train. \\n Note on narrators: they're, all three, terrific, and as an added bonus, the woman reading Megan has an accent identical to Doctor Who's Rose Tyler (Billie Piper).\",\n",

And ultimately that boils down to a three star review. \\n I loved Hayder's take on the relationship between the estranged sisters, Sally and Zoe. Their relationship--focused on the strength of the two women--is the best thing about this book. Zoe must ask someone for help; Sally must find it in herself to refuse help. It's a simple character development, but it was produced and examined by a deft literary hand. \\n Hayder is at times poetic and is always graphic in the way she depicts the violence in the book's world. This duality works for me, but if you've got a weak stomach for violence (most of it against women), then I'd recommend you avoid this book. \\n Rosalyn Landor does terrific work narrating this book.

And I know that makes me sound snobby, but remember that I just read him, too. \\n If you\\'re reading this as a woman living in the 21st century, you might not dig all of the roles Woods puts his female characters into, but it\\'s a male author writing a male protagonist in a popular thriller that takes place in the 1970s.

Basically, she's an action hero. I think the only reason I find it to be significant is that she's a woman, and the fact that Maitland gives her so many physical hurdles to sling herself over is a sign of him being a feminist. Or a misogynist. But let's say feminist, because I want to keep enjoying his books. \\n Otherwise, it's a fun book.

Now, I don\\'t mind that they\\'re powerless. In fact it\\'s this very powerlessness makes it a true tale of horror alongside stories like Rosemary\\'s Baby and The Lady Vanishes where the female characters are manipulated, psychologically tortured, betrayed, and made to think that they are crazy. I love stories like this; I find them to be much more terrifying than stories of ghosts or monsters (although yes, Rosemary\\'s Baby is a monster story, but that\\'s not what makes it so scary). But, because The Woman in White is a product of its time, the women cannot overcome their situation or their nemesis alone. They must use a man--albeit a man who we as readers are rooting for--to do the work for them. \\n Even Marion, who is a strong and independent female character and easily the heroine of Collins\\'s story, is only allowed to live because of Count Fosco. He admires her (and loves her) so that he helps her to live when she comes down with fever and tuberculosis. He reads her diary and makes notes about, essentially, how *cute* it is. And it is Fosco who ultimately holds the power to confess his deeds in writing and give Marion\\'s sister Laura her identity back. \\n And then we realize that Laura wouldn\\'t have even inherited Limmeridge House if she\\'d not had a male child. (And did anyone notice that as soon as Walter and Laura get married he almost exclusively refers to her as \"my wife\" instead of using her name? Come on, Walt.) \\n Now, none of this is surprising given the book\\'s historical context. But it\\'s still irritating. Yes, I enjoyed the book; it\\'s well written, well narrated (Bailey and Prebble are great), and a solid mystery.

Claire is an amazing character, and a fantastic detective. She's a coke-snorting, green tea-drinking, sex-having private fu@#ing detective. She apologizes for nothing and is hell bent on destroying herself. Which is why Gran gets both the smack upside the head and the high fives: because DeWitt is right on the edge of destruction there at the end of the book, and Gran just walks away. She leaves the reader with a few mysteries solved, though of course, not all. \\n What Gran does beautifully is give us a story that builds on Claire's character in the present and not-so-distant past--with the mystery of Paul's death--and builds on Claire's adolescent character as a budding detective--with the Case of the End of the World and the stories about Tracy. By layering more information about Tracy, and the very important clue about her contacting Chloe, Gran is building a character, a single mystery, and a rich series of books inching satisfyingly toward a payoff. \\n Now, do I really think that Gran will let Claire die before we figure out the truth about Tracy's disappearance?

But that never happens. Mankell tells a story that is much, much too complicated for a single book, and never tense or dramatic. Could it have been a trilogy? Sure, why not? Then he could have really explored the political aspects that take up so much of the plot but never quite feel connected to the massacre. It\\'s not quite a political thriller, and it\\'s not quite a murder/serial killer mystery, and it\\'s not quite a tale of historically motivated revenge.

Rendell gives each character a small piece of the puzzle, and it is in this way--and her terrific third person narration--that she is able to build such great tension. The reader sees all of the individual pieces and knows where they need to go, but it takes just about to the end of the story until they\\'re fit together. \\n I usually don\\'t like it when Rendell summarizes the endings of her books to give a sort of \"where are they now\" finale. But in this one it works because of the Portobello Road framework. It was, all in all, a very satisfying read.',\n",
       " 'I downloaded this book in February of 2012, after watching a couple of the Bones t.v. shows featuring this Walter Sherman,\"Finder,\" character. The character and premise was cute and humorous, so I figured I\\'d give the books a try. But then the character got a spinoff show, and the few episodes I watched really didn\\'t do it for me (too cute; too humorous), and I forgot about the book. \\n But the other day, while I told myself that I had to get through my current Audible library before I could download any new books, I came across The Knowland Retribution and figured I\\'d give it a listen. And I was pleasantly surprised. \\n The story and the character of Walter Sherman are much more serious than the t.v. producers gave them credit for, which is a shame. They turned the idea into a caricature and reduced Sherman\\'s age (and thus his maturity) by about 25 years. His older, better, book version--while certainly not as appealing to an 18 - 35 year old t.v. audience--is certainly more interesting. \\n The story is not a who-done-it or even a why\\'d-he-do-it, but a smart and slowly paced thriller involving big agriculture, Wall Street greed, and a lot of loss, both of the financial and the human kind. The characters are interesting, the story is nicely complex, and the bad guys are just who you\\'d want them to be (and they get just what they should in the end). \\n Marc Vietor does a very nice job reading this, too. His deep, serious narration gives the story an additional weight. I\\'ll definitely be downloading the next in Greener\\'s series.',\n",

And in hindsight I realize that Sanders does the reader a service by giving us so much about Daniel Blank and Edward X. Delaney during the first section of the book. This character development and story groundwork are essential for the rest of the book\\'s tension and meticulous plotting. \\n I love the back-and-forth sections dealing with the narrative \"sides\" of the story, and I love that Sanders gives us not a mystery of \"who-done-it\" but a mystery of procedure, logic, and method.

So it wasn't good enough to get published on its own; he had to publish something better (presumably) and build a name for himself. Ugh. \\n His afterword notes that he wrote the characters and the setting as tribute to the gothic horror novels of Stoker and Lovecraft, but his homage really falls flat. The characters are underdeveloped and forgettable, the plot and conflict are boring, and there's very little atmosphere.

But it seemed to take itself a bit too seriously, which I think (having also read the equally unbelievable Sharp Objects) might be an earmark of Flynn's fiction. \\n Here's the thing: Flynn can write. She has a great voice and an attitude of playfulness when it comes to narrative. But it's as though she had this great idea for a really interesting thriller told using an innovative narrative style, but then she didn't know how to finish it. So, about halfway through the book, it turns into a Lifetime movie. And the really, really corny Lifetime movie. Not the one starring Kathy Bates or Shirley MacClaine, but the one starring that one actress you saw in that one episode of Melrose Place in 1997. \\n One of the book club babes made the argument that the book was about the bubble that bursts in a relationship when you realize that both people are being untruthful about who they really are. And yes, there are certainly elements of that. But the plot is so overly dramatic that it never felt like a true theme, which is unfortunate because I'd have liked to read that story. \\n I don't think there's a likeable character in the book. Or a realistic emotional connection, except for, perhaps, Nick and Go's. Otherwise, it's a cast of weirdos doing weirdo things.

The characters living in the Kavach building (or at least the ones we're introduced to; I don't agree with Clines's decision to add more names of residents we haven't met. Why not just limit it to those playing a role in the story?), are relatable and layered in mysteries of their own. The Kavach building is certainly a mystery to be solved, but I had no clue as to what was waiting for me on the other side of room 14. Clines's story is a bit of House of Leaves, a dash of hard science fiction, and just enough fantasy (the squales, good god, the squales) to scare the pants off of me. \\n I scanned a review that was likening it to Lost, and while I loved the first couple seasons of that show, I think it would be a disservice to compare 14 to something that wasn't well thought through. Clines has a nice complexity without being overly contrived, and it's clear from the beginning that he knows exactly where he is (and you are) going, even if you don't have a clue. It's his ride, and I loved being on it. \\n The narrator, Ray Porter, was great. He worried me during the first ten minutes--I thought he might a little too Hollywood.

Her Susan is too whiny--and that transfers over to almost all of her other female characters (Bliss, Pearl, and even sometimes Claire, which is offensive)--her Archie was too growly, and her Gretchen was too sultry, even for Gretchen. I know she was drugged up for most of it, but it sounded like she was talking through a throat full of Jello. \\n About forty minutes from the end of the book I got lost in the thought of how Cain would write the next book--with yet another serial killer in the city of Portland? For the love of god! But Cain fixed that problem right quick with a nice, suitable ending.

Way above and beyond. \\n There were many a point in this book that I was cringing, but each gruesome detail is totally worth it and, although it's grotesque and horrifying, the violence never feels gratuitous.

Mackey plays a role in this new story, but it\\'s Stephen who takes the lead. \\n French plays with point-of-view in this book, and it\\'s successful. The story of Chris Harper\\'s murder is approached from the present, with Moran and his \"partner\" DI Conway, and Moran is narrating first person as he and Conway tread though the lies upon lies told by two packs of teenage boarding school students. \\n And while Moran and Conway move backwards to retrace what happened and solve Chris\\'s murder, the other side of the narration is moving forward from months before the murder happened. This approach uses a third person point-of-view that dips into each of the minds of the main players in this drama, a quartet of best friends: Holly, Julia, Selena, and Rebecca. \\n As usual, French\\'s prose is rich and paints a beautiful setting for the characters to navigate. And, as usual, the setting is essential to the conflict. I really enjoyed this story, especially the new narrative style and subject matter French is playing with.

Rendell makes him just naive enough (it\\'s his youth, really, and that youthful hope is believable) so that the reader is just a bit up on him most of the time, although we don\\'t get the whole story until the very end. \\n Christine, Philip\\'s mother, turns out to be a much more complex character than I initially took her for, but what\\'s nice is that her complexity and resilience surprises Philip, too. The rest of the cast is well drawn, though it is Senta who steals the show.

Both The Rottweiler and The Water\\'s Lovely ended with disappointing and unnecessary summaries of the characters\\' lives (e.g. \"X and Y went on to get married...,\" \"R was arrested...\"). This book, however, didn\\'t over explain and as a result the ending was hopeless and revealing just where and when it needed to be.',\n",

It's also a book that deals with child murder and infanticide, so be warned if you're squeamish about such things. \\n A note on the narrator, Justine Eyre: she does a mostly good job. She's the narrator for Lauren Beukes's Zoo City (which I loved) and Eyre's Swedish accent for Unwanted sounds very much like the South African accent she does for Zoo City. I didn't mind that -- I actually enjoyed it because I like the sound of her voice in that accent -- but there were a handful of times that she drops the accent altogether for a line or two before getting back into it.

It's a perfect combination for me and I will be re-reading this often while I wait for her next book. \\n And a quick note on the audiobook narrator, Stephen Hogan: he does a spot-on job.

Dalgliesh is observing something, the knowledge comes to him, we never knew how, and that is that. End of story.

Second, the majority of the book takes place on a ship that is traveling from Istanbul to Genoa, Italy, and I do love books that are confined to boats, trains, or planes. There\\'s something immediately romantic, civilized, and terrifying about a setting where it\\'s possible to drink a martini and play a hand of bridge after dinner, and then get murdered in your cabin while the other passengers are sleeping peacefully. \\n My only complaint about this book is that Ambler sets up an element of setting on the ship that I thought was going to be very important in the plot, but it turned out to be just a minor way to get to know two of the characters. He makes the walls between the cabins paper-thin so that Graham, our hero, can hear everything his French neighbors--Mme. and M. Mathis--say in the adjoining room. I kept waiting for these thin walls to play a larger part, since the characters referenced them a number of times in more serious situations.

The story itself is a bitter love letter to New Orleans. The post-storm world that Gran leads us through is dilapidated, sad, and poor, though many pockets are still rich and alive with color and history. The characters each have their own specific survival stories, which makes this a mystery both of the hurricane as well as of the murder Claire has come back to New Orleans to solve. In fact, the survival aspect of the story is frequently more interesting than the murder. \\n Gran creates a strong sense of noir through the book, and it works so nicely with this modern story. Claire DeWitt and the world she's in are hard-boiled, but never in a false way. I am curious, though, to see if the next book (I'm assuming [hoping] there will be at least one more Claire DeWitt mystery) can work in the same atmosphere-rich noir way in a different location. DeWitt lives in San Francisco but grew up in Brooklyn, the city of her biggest personal mystery, so it makes sense she'd go there next. But New York might be too easy; I'd like to see her somewhere stranger. Like Omaha or Detroit. \\n The story is told first person, which I don't always like but is successful here. Carol Monda, the audiobook narrator, is hard voiced and perfectly cast for this story and this narrator.

Not only is it an important book that I'm happy to have had my students read (all 81 of them), but they responded with interesting and insightful comments and discussions. It's a great book for college students because they've got a little perspective on high school, but they're not that far removed from it. My veteran students were also great additions to the discussion when it turned to PTSD and gun control, especially conceal-carry laws. I overheard some students the other week during their small group work saying that this was the first book they've enjoyed reading in college, and although that's kind of a sad statement for them, I was a little--selfishly--pleased as well. \\n And thank you Dave Cullen, for the excellent teaching materials. I used a lot of them and they were very helpful. I've decided to teach this at least one more semester, possibly more, so I might add a third review. Why not? There's always something new to be found in great books.\",\n",

Lackberg has a nice attention to character and atmosphere, which built the tension nicely. And although there\\'s a lot going on in the plot and the ending borders on a \"gotcha,\" I never felt it was forced or too contrived (my guess for the ending, based on another story [or t.v. show--I can\\'t remember] that had used the same trick, turned out to be correct). I ultimately enjoyed the sub-plots enough to be interested in reading Lackberg\\'s first novel, focusing on Erika (who I really like), although there were some sub-plot details that didn\\'t really go anywhere. These bits were well written enough that I didn\\'t really mind, and I think that\\'s probably just part of coming into a series without any background or context. \\n The narrator, David Thorn, was also quite good, so if you\\'re thinking about listening to this one, I\\'d recommend it.',\n",

And, not surprisingly, Vonnegut was right. This is a fun, tight little crime fiction novel starring one Travis McGee, who is apparently the star of a series of MacDonald's books. The pace and characters reminded me very much of Elmore Leonard's fiction, which I adore.

It doesn't have the same great atmosphere that No Trace does, and as a result I just didn't get into the story and peripheral characters. And although Maitland did an okay job with the Jamaican accented dialogue, it was occasionally a bit forced. There is a Brock-related bombshell that's dropped, and although it's potentially a big deal, it, too, felt contrived. But I'll wait to see what the newest one gives us. It had better be good.\",\n",

It's got a secluded feeling because of the location and nature of the crime/s, so even though the story takes place in London, it feels so much more intimate. And, really, thinking about it now, Maitland does this a lot: he seems to insulate his locations, thus his stories and characters, which is the perfect kind of atmosphere for a nice mystery--cozy and menacing at the same time. His stories are intricate without being overly complicated, he throws in the right number of red herrings, and he develops his characters more and more with each action, scene, and book.\",\n",
       " \"(Add 1/2 star to my rating, please.) \\n This turned out to be a really good read. The story straddles two time periods and a few cities: Oslo, 2000 and Leningrad & Vienna, 1944. It took me a while to really catch onto the heart of the story, which might have had to do with the fact that I listened to this instead of reading it and, as a result, occasionally missed the date/chapter transitions and character names while I was navigating traffic. It also might have had to do with the half dozen Norwegian soldiers Nesbo introduces us to within the first few chapters--I kept forgetting who was who (which, actually, might have been the point). \\n I didn't know much about Norway's role in World War II, so I found this element of the plot very interesting. Nesbo was able to work in the history and its effect on contemporary Norway while keeping my interest and the integrity of the plot. Actually, it elevated and complicated the plot. He created great parallels between the eras as well as a realistic and sympathetic sense of cause and effect. The characters were fairly well drawn and believable--though I'm sure I'd have gotten more into the book and the characters if I'd started with the first Harry Hole book instead of this, the third (but the first and second weren't available on Audible, so I did what I had to do). \\n There was a moment near the end when I was certain that Nesbo had jumped the shark, and although he sort of recovered, it was still an odd, out-of-nowhere, obvious red herring. Although, by the end, there were bits that I hadn't quite figured out, so I guess the mystery remained intact until the reveal. But I still didn't like it. \\n A note on the narrator, Robin Sachs: not only did he have a nice deep, soothing mystery narrator's voice, but his accents were spot-on--he had to do some Viennese and some German, and each was natural. Also, his transitions among the characters and his take on female voices were all perfect--just a subtle lowering or softening of the voice and I knew who was who. Just great. (and I'm especially sensitive to this because the book I'm currently listening to has a less than stellar American narrator whose English accent is something out of a high school production of Noel Coward.) So if you're considering listening to this, certainly do. Although I won't immediately start listening to the next book in the series, it's certainly on my list.\",\n",

The mystery--though an absolute page turner, especially the last 100 or so pages--is a bit over the top (and \"a bit\" might be an understatement).

Lelic keeps all aspects of this book balanced: it\\'s a police procedural with a very likable lead detective, a psychological and behavioral analysis, and an oral history all wrapped up. \\n Lucia reminds me a bit of a greener version of Barry Maitland\\'s Kathy Kolla. Her experiences in the precinct echo those of Samuel\\'s, and although the parallels are obvious, they\\'re no less frightening. And the narrative style--third person for Lucia\\'s experiences and first person accounts, interview style, from the witnesses of the shooting--is the perfect narrative tool to unravel the mystery (and the cast of narrators for the audiobook are spot-on and great to listen to). \\n I could have lived without the Harry love interest ending--Lucia\\'s strength should have stood on its own. And I also could have also done with more about the truly innocent victims of Samuel\\'s shooting. The children and teacher who, for lack of a better phrase, \"got in his way,\" were a bit minimized for my comfort since, at the end, I felt that Samuel was a fully sympathetic character and wanted to shoot Dom and Travis myself.

It was odd to read an Archie and Susan book without Gretchen Lowell (though she makes a brief appearance at the end), but Cain fills up the Beauty Killer-shaped hole with new and likable (and new and creepy) characters. \\n My only fault with this was the narrator. She \"did\" a lot of the voices using way too affected accents and timbres, and her interpretations frequently didn\\'t meet the voice I\\'d already created in my head after reading three previous books with the same characters. So if you\\'re listening to this instead of reading it, beware that Susan sounds like she\\'s about thirteen, Archie\\'s voice is so weirdly gravelly that I sighed in annoyance almost every time he had dialogue (think Christian Bale\\'s Batman voice channeled through a woman), and Ann(e?)

It's interesting when done in the movies about real-life characters, but it's irritating when done about fictional characters. I realized just tonight after finishing this one that she doesn't do that with the Wexfords (or at least I don't recall that she does), and I'd bet that it's because they're part of a series, and we'll get to read more about him in later books. A clearer--or stronger, really--ending for this one would give a pop rather than a fizzle, which is what this had and it left me feeling, again, cheated. Otherwise, it's a really well told and well written thriller with complex and (mostly) likable characters.\",\n",

Wodehouse--there were a lot of young people running around, getting into hijinks, loving one another without professing love for one another. But it was, of course, less folly and more murder.

I'd prefer him to not use it at all and stick with Kolla. I also miss how much Brock was in the mix during The Malcontenta; he's been more of an outsider in the last two.

I think that Coben suffers from DanBrownitis: heaping on enough unnecessary details throughout the novel to make Chekhov\\'s Gun turn over in its literary grave. \\n And to top it all off, this audiobook was narrated by Scott Brick, who also narrated Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? In the Dick novel, Brick\\'s halting narrative technique fits; it\\'s a distopic reality filled with androids and android bounty hunters. His weird, nasal voice and Shatneresque delivery fit quite perfectly. BUT, in a straight-forward thriller, it does not work at all. It is also laughable when he does \"accents\": New Jersey Cop, New Jersey Jew, Latino Couple, Russian Gangster, Other Russian Gangster. There was one section of third-person narration--not dialogue-- where I swear that he actually worked in the hint of an accent. That is not necessary and just downright idiotic. \\n Had I read the novel rather than listen to it, I might not have had such issues. But I actually sighed, yelled, and laughed at various moments during Brick\\'s narration, something I haven\\'t done since The Road audiobook and its moronic narration (yes, I know it\\'s supposed to be brilliant. I\\'ll give it another shot and read it the old fashioned way). \\n I know this is a long review and I apologize. But it was such an irritating book. I should have just stopped listening, but after an hour or so I chalked my irritation up to the narration and tried to get over it (unsuccessfully) and then I got hooked by this great sub-plot, and then I was too far into the mystery to not find out what happened. But I\\'ll sleep better at night knowing that I never have to read another one of Coben\\'s books again.',\n",

It\\'s an epistolary novel (a term I learned after reading this book), which means that it\\'s a series of letters written by the characters. In this novel, the characters writing the narratives are doing so to try to figure out the mysterious disappearance of the Moonstone, a gigantic Indian diamond stolen by a British military captain. The narrators are terrific; each takes on a distinctly different voice, and Collins does a brilliant job of writing each first-person account as not only an entry in the mystery, but also a detailed character exploration. The reader, Peter Jeffrey, is wonderful. He develops distinct, perfectly suited voices for each of the writers. And he does something I really appreciate: he doesn\\'t do a \"woman\" voice for our only female writer, Clack (Drusilla Clack, a kooky religious spinster), he just gives a pompous and elitist voice, which is her to a \"t\". \\n I\\'d recommend this book, though not for listening on traffic-heavy, rainy afternoons.

He didn't do much explanation about the previous book, which was nice. He assumed that his reader had read it, and if they hadn't, well, then they'd just have to catch up on their own. I appreciated this about it, though it did make me wish there was a fourth book on its way...soon. \\n I agree with J.C. and Angie that I'll have to re-read them all through sometime in the not-so-distant future (I have a feeling that I'll need a Salander fix in a few months).\",\n",

The prose, while not particularly great, is solidly okay--clean and simple--and this also keeps the eyes moving quickly (although, FYI Barclay: no one in the states refers to drunk people as being \"pissed,\" nor do many use the term \"bum\" to refer to a behind). It\\'s a terrifying premise (I\\'d imagine especially for parents), but Barclay mucks about with a lot of twists, one of which is absolutely--ABSOLUTELY--unnecessary. Also, he\\'s got a huge, glaring, flamboyant Chekhov\\'s Gun: the moose. This is not a spoiler, and will only make your life easier. Don\\'t mind the moose. Enough said. \\n Barclay also does something I tell my creative writing students not to do, which is write this line: \"A solitary tear ran down her left cheek\" (398). I tell them to avoid this because solitary tears appear only in mediocre books and movies. Hmm. This actually applies to FTW in more ways than one, since by page 50 or so, I was already imagining how much money this will make when it\\'s turned into a film.

James doesn't explain too much about him--which I like because although it's #11 in the 'series' I easily picked it up and read it. On the flip side, because I haven't been through ten other books with him and his other detectives, and because I don't get a load of back story, I didn't really care about him too much. \\n The mystery itself was fine, although not the sort I usually flip over. I adore Christie's big 'reveals' with Poirot where the murderer is shown up and all is explained. James is much more understated about it (more modern, perhaps?), and as a result I felt it was a bit anti-climactic. Dalgliesh suspected who it was, pretty much knew who it was, and then they just had to get evidence and then catch him. So not a lot of mystery. \\n Beautifully written, though. James's prose is terrific and the narrator was great. I think I just prefer the thriller type books of hers (Children of Men). Although I might read the first AD book to see if it sucks me in.\",\n",

He bounces from character to character without ever giving the reader so much as an inkling of whiplash. It's especially effective--essential, really--when Lisbeth Salander gets into a bit of trouble and disappears from the story for a bit. Because we're in everyone else's head so much, it drives the reader crazy with tension for not knowing, but not crazy for inadequate writing, which could have easily been the case. \\n Salander is a rock star in this story. She's hacking, punching, macing, smirking, eating Billy's Pan Pizza, and doing other Salander-esque things. Characters from Millenium #1 are developed more fully here, and we get oodles of new ones, too (my personal favorite was the boxer Paolo Roberto). I was happy to see Blomkvist here again, though he was a bit more in the background until mid-way through the book. Larsson also ties up a major loose end from #1, which made me sigh with relief. He also gives us another, smaller, loose end with Blomkvist's newest lover (I cannot wait to see who plays him in the almost certainly to-be-made films. What a player!). This early teaser and other hints make me way excited to read on for the third one, though it looks like I've got to wait until October to get my hands on it. I have a feeling we're going to read a lot more about Salander's sister... \\n So, definitely check this out, but you'll do yourself a favor by reading The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo first; it's not necessary for the plot, but it's really nice for the character development.\",\n",

And some characters' reactions to the twists are a bit odd. But, I was hooked after the first twenty or so pages, and it kept me reading constantly all the way through. I also really like Salander, and look forward to reading the next in his trilogy, where she stars. She's a fragile figure in many ways, and strong and hard to identify with in others, so I'd like to see if she can carry an entire novel.

Cullen doesn\\'t approach the story chronologically and this organization was, at first, frustrating and difficult to tell when he was switching between times and characters; however, once I got to know the ten or so characters he was focusing on, it was much easier, and about a quarter of the way through reading the book I was thankful he organized it that way. It was hard enough--emotionally--to listen to the shot-by-shot account of the massacre, but I don\\'t think I\\'d have been able to listen to it at all if it had been built up to for seven or thirteen hours and then came at the middle or the end (another reason I want to read the hard copy is so that I can clarify some timeline questions I have but skip some of the more gruesome sections).

There are two mysteries intertwined, and though we only get to solve one of them, it's surprisingly satisfying. \\n 'Woods' is narrated in the first person by Adam Robert Ryan, an Irishman who was abducted with two of his young friends when they were twelve; his friends disappeared, presumed murdered, and Adam escaped and survived, left with no memory of the event or the day that led up to the event. He grows up, becomes a murder detective, and partners up with Cassie Maddox (one of my favorite new heroines and apparently the star of the French follow-up, which I'll be reading soon), a young, tough, former narcotics cop. They catch the case of a twelve-year-old who's been found, murdered, in the same wood where Ryan and his friends were taken. \\n The use of Ryan's first-person narration is key to the story, and French handles the male perspective spot-on (from what I can tell--men, is she indeed spot-on?). Things not so clear to Ryan are naggingly suspicious to the reader, and, as we find out, to Cassie Maddox as well. The case they're working does get solved (though it's a frustratingly unsatisfying punishment for the killer) and the tension building up to the end had be yelling at the book and thumping my steering wheel while listening to it in the car.

Highsmith does a great job of maturing Ripley, especially in these last two novels (this and Ripley's Game). He hasn't exactly grown a conscience (actually, far from it), but he's not the hot headed sociopath we love so much from the first two novels. He's still adventurous, courageous, calculating, and a bit brash, but he's more emotional and, actually, a bit melancholy. That might have to do with the ending of this particular book (not a happily ever after...), but now, thinking more about it, the tone and action fit quite well.

I thought there were a couple of sections that were pretty stagnant and whatnot but nonetheless I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Some moments had me on the edge of my seat and I just HAD to read on to find out what happened. Also, me reading this close to Halloween means that I've been reading/watching some scary stuff and since this book is like a mystery/thriller-ish there were some moments I would look around my room, paranoid. Strong debut if you ask me! \\n Also this book was really focused on how Becca was struggling with leaving her small town and since I don't really live in a small town I couldn't exactly relate but it was still interesting to read nonetheless. I wonder if that is how people really feel like?\",\n",

There was some decent suspense that made it an enjoyable read. \\n I do think that Clark needs to make his female characters more realistic.

This is where the Rockford Files were seeded, Simon and Simon conceived, Riptide docked. This is where the Burn Notice was lit. If you've ever watched a show where the good guys are only mostly good, and every week they are helping some other unfortunate soul that's been dealt a rough hand fight back, then this book is for you. \\n The Deep Blue Good-By isn't a deep novel. What it is a great escape from the mundane, to a world where a guy living on a houseboat can solve crimes, right wrongs, and still has time to sip a beer at sunset. While at times a little dated, given the fact that it was published in the 60's, it stands up pretty well.\",\n",

While much shorter than I anticipated (though fitting for a novel written 80 years ago, granted), it was a fun, quick, titillating read of love, murder, and a hot California summer.',\n",
       " \"It pains me to give a Stephen King book only three stars. Bear with me. \\n Billed as a sequel to The Shining, I felt this book fell short. I've read the Shining more than once (yes, despite it's awkward at times prose and POV mishaps, it is worth it). Even having read it multiple times and now being in my *ahem* rather late thirties, when I read the Shining last fall in anticipation of this book, I still had times where I got goosebumps and jumped at random noises and shadows in the house. Despite the fact that it's starting to get long in the tooth (HAH, DS readers will chuckle), the Shining still serves as a great book for getting a bit of creepy fright. \\n Doctor Sleep, a continuation of that story, held no fright. There was suspense, and even action, but no spine tingling, bone chilling, jump at the shadows because two keys on the piano just started playing and no one's there scare. While a lot of that is due to who King has become as a writer in the last few decades, focussing more on the weaving of a good story over giving his readers the heebie jeebies, in a book that is supposed to be a successor, its absence was noteable. There was a type of urban science fiction (for lack of a better term) that was really popular in the late seventies and early eighties dealing with psychics and ESP. A fine enough topic, and this was a great book in that sub-genre, but without anything to counter balance it I was left wanting. This was a psychic hero explores his life and powers book, not a REDRUM thriller. \\n As a sequel, then, I give this three stars. It did not stand up to the bar that was set by its predecessor. The book would have been better suited if the lead character had not been named Danny Torrence - then it would have been just another King affectation of setting one novel in the world of another (Sidewinder). Then the fact that we have a book that obsesses over steam, a purported sequel to a book that obsessed over a steam boiler, but that only once almost made a cross reference wouldn't bother me so much.\",\n",
       " \"Jow Hill's Heart-Shaped Box is the kind of story you don't see often enough these days - a classic ghost story. Not a ghoul-fest, just a classic, straight up haunting and exorcism of a sorts. This is a solid three star book, not quite up to par with Horns, but still a decent read. As another reviewer said, I think my biggest problem was that the level of peril never seemed to be quite imminent. Hauntings run a thin line, and I think Hill was trying to avoid crossing over it, but the final result was a book that didn't quite drag me along in the middle. Plus, living in Fredericksburg, I kept getting distracted for that part of that book :)\",\n",

Bartender Billy finds himself trapped as a madman begins leaving him notes, suggesting that Billy is in control of choosing to take action and cause a grisly death, or side with inaction and still be responsible for something an equally horrific death. I don't think Koontz quite delivered on that promise, but he made a good run at it.\",\n",
       " \"Folks that get here by way of the TV show Haven will be sorely disappointed - like many of King's work turned into film, the names are the same, the places are the same, but little else runs the way you expect it to. This book is a mystery - if the imprint didn't give that away - but it's less about solving the mystery than learning what makes it so mysterious. A fun quick read, told mostly like a ghost story (third person narration).\",\n",
       " \"I needed something that was fun to read, knew not to take itself too seriously, and was outside my usual reading circles without being just foreign. Horns fit the bill, and I'm glad I read it. While I think Hill played the devilish references a bit much (from the Evil Knieval trail to the number of times he throws 666 out there), the book was still a fun read and well worth the price of admission. To sum up, because we don't waste too many words: Horns is the story of a young man that wakes up one morning, a year after his love was raped and murdered, to discover a pair of horns growing out of his skull. In particularly, I kind of enjoyed the fact that the Devil can be a superhero in the right light.\",\n",

       " \"A murder mystery set in a hypothetical prehistorical time in which Neanderthals lived in what is now North America, Death in the Time of Ice presents the reader with an interesting backdrop for a classic murder mystery and proves that crime is as old as time itself. \\n The main character is Enga Dancing Flower, who believes that she and her sister are valued and accepted members of their adopted tribe, until the tribe's beloved leader is found murdered. Suspicion, and superstition, cause accusations to be thrown at most tribe members, but especially on Enga because of her outspoken belief that the leader was murdered by one of them instead of an outsider, as the tribe would like to believe. \\n In addition to the murder, Enga's tribe must deal with electing a new leader, the scary prospect of moving their village to better hunting grounds, personal injuries and natural disasters. \\n The book offers a gloriously detailed and innovative imagining of prehistory and prehistoric customs (the tribe do not communicate verbally; they mind-read), along with a satisfying murder plot, several conspiracies, and a few romances. It was an engrossing read, and I would follow the characters on through other books if the author decides to make a prehistoric series. \\n I would recommend Death in the Time of Ice to anyone who, as I did, enjoyed the Jean M. Auel Earth's Children series, or who would like to savor a good whodunnit set in a completely new surrounding. \\n I received a copy of Death in the Time of Ice in exchange for a review.\",\n",
       " \"I have to say I don't think I was the right audience for this book. \\n I enjoy books that are set in other places and which feature travelers as main characters because I want the setting to also function like a character. While that was true for Nightmare in Morocco, I found that I was not receptive to a book in which the exotic setting is itself a villain. \\n Nightmare in Morocco is about a young American travel guide who lives in Spain. Her boss pleads with her to guide a tour to Morocco just once, but she is haunted by a bad experience traveling in that country as a child. She agrees to do the tour, even though a family tragedy occurs and she is left as the guardian for her wild step-niece. The main character, Noa, is understandably stressed by several factors--her job and her recent family problems, for example. However, she spends so much of the book dwelling on her childhood trauma in Morocco (she got lost in a bazaar) that it made me question how the character could believably have chosen to be a tour guide as a profession. For someone who had supposedly lived and traveled abroad almost since birth, according to the backstory, it was hard for me to accept that Noa would be so prejudiced and socially sheltered. \\n Because, though there are also human baddies, Morocco itself is a sinister presence in the book. And, I don't think I was the right reader for that kind of story. \\n Nightmare in Morocco is a short read and contains both a mystery and a romance. The romance was more fun than the mystery for me, though I enjoyed following the threads of the plot in both. Several of the characters are also enjoyable, and some of the scenes that feature a more lighthearted atmosphere--such as the camel ride--are fun to visualize. \\n I wouldn't recommend this book as travel inspiration for Morocco (a country which I have, in fact, visited), but if you are looking for a shorter read in a 1980s-style romance, take a look. \\n I received a copy of Nightmare in Morocco in exchange for a review.\",\n",

I also might add that I love cheesy Lifetime movies and \"light\" murder mysteries a la Mary Higgins Clark. This book, however, was so repetitive, boring, and downright boring that by halfway through, I knew the only reason to keep reading was to be able to write this review! \\n Here are a few highlights: \\n -The cast of characters/suspects in this tale are so dull. The author kept listing them, describing them, describing their offices, over and over. Even so, I couldn\\'t seem to keep them straight and honestly, I really didn\\'t care to try. I felt like I was at work - if I were to work at a really boring foundation. Such a terrible setting for what could have been an interesting premise (being able to read a cat\\'s mind). \\n -Even the main characters weren\\'t well developed. And some of the plot points involving them were just ridiculous. Chloe is such a \"free spirit\" that she fails to even mention all of the serious crime and vandalism that has been going on at her place of work when she asks her sister to take over her job? (Seriously, what workplace would even let an employee bring in a random relative to take over her job while she is on vacation in Tahiti? How long is Chloe planning to be in Tahiti anyway?). And the idea of Chloe writing such a long and descriptive letter but not having the time to actually talk to Neela? About anything?? And when Neela finds out that she and her sister are the number one suspects in a major theft, she doesn\\'t even try to reach Chloe to discuss it with her? (Steve was able to reach her when he tried). I\\'m just not buying any of it! \\n -This is random but at least three times the author used an unusual word/phrase twice within a short amount of time. So odd. Examples: the words \"sardonic\" and \"ebullient\" - when you see it once, okay. When you see it again within a chapter or two - weird. The worst was the phrase \"halfway across a continent\" to describe Oklahoma relative to California. Used not once but twice. I get that Neela was feeling far from home - but she was in Oklahoma, not Australia! Oklahoma is only a few states away from California! \\n I feel badly writing a negative review but this book is definitely not worth your time. :(',\n",

       " 'Cookies, Corpses, and the Deadly Haunt by Rachael Stapleton is a possibly paranormal, cozy mystery with a dash of humour and romance and tonnes of mouth-watering desserts! \\n The story is about Juniper and fellow house-flipper, former fiance and current crush Jack, who buy homes, refurbish them and resell them for a profit. The two go to Jack\\'s hometown, where they acquire a property known as The Doctor\\'s House, famed to have been built by a doctor, who later killed his wife and himself in the house. The townspeople also want to host a Halloween ball at the house. However, after acquiring the property, Juniper discovers the body of the mayor\\'s daughter, Kaitlin. \\n While working at the house, Juniper often hears music coming from an unknown source and glimpses the lady in white, whom some townspeople claim is Veronica, the Doctor\\'s wife. \\n Although the dead body appears at around chapter seven, the setting of the stage is not boring but rather interesting and fun, giving the reader a good feel of the setting and the characters. \\n \"It was a dark-haired woman in a light lace dress creeping up the mansion\\'s front steps. A gush of wind sent fallen leaves dancing down the steps around her. She was pale as a ghost.\" \\n In addition to the mystery, Juniper continues to suffer from jealousy as her business partner, Jack is getting married soon to none other than \"Sally Big Boobs\". \\n Apart from Juniper, there is Pike, who co-jointly owns the bakery with Lulu who owns the neighbouring clothes store. Together, they named the business \"Cookies and Corsets\". The cafe\\'s wicked assortment of desserts had me drooling as I read. \\n Because it\\'s a small town, there are a lot of relatives in the story, which boggled me sometimes, especially with the non-recurrent characters. I felt like I needed a family tree. \\n There were a lot of characters I liked in Cookies, Corpses, and the Deadly Haunt, such as Pike, Officer Cody, Juniper, and Lulu. \\n The romance in the novel was fun to read and clean. It also added a bit of awkwardness and humour for the characters. \\n However, a problem I had with the book was that, and I can only assume this, the book was at some point written in first person then changed to third person (or vice versa). The book is mostly narrated in the third person; however, there were some instances when J. suddenly switched to first then back to third. It was just weird and interrupted the narrative. Especially since it occurred frequently, once even switching between first and third in the same sentence. This cut my review by one whole star. \\n (Reviewer update: I was just informed that the copy I had received for the blog tour was an Advanced Reader\\'s Copy (ARC) and that the final and updated version of Cookies, Corpses, and the Deadly Haunt is devoid of the above problem, raising my overall rating to 4 stars). \\n I like how Stapleton kept me wondering about the paranormal aspect of the story throughout.',\n",
       " '\"I speak if I have something worth saying,\" Meredith stated politely. \"And I have nothing to do with what you all do. I leave these matters in the hands of the experts.\" \\n \"The police?\" [Sean] asked. \"I agree.\" \\n Meredith winced and shook her head. \"I meant the three of you.\" \\n The book opens with Sara and Sean, a married couple and retired police officers, discussing their Halloween House fundraiser, and considering a Christmas one. The couple, recently turned billionaires, after the loss of a family member, love to do charity work. \\n As part of coverage of their fundraiser, they show news reporter Chloe Parsons around their House of Horrors for children. Later the next day when they gather to see the story on TV, they learn that Chloe has passed away. \\n Sara feels that Chloe has been murdered, making their investigation harder as the police are also investigating it as a \\'murder\\'. Plus, it\\'s just a hunch for Sara. Not long after, Chloe\\'s sister comes to their private investigations firm and asks them to investigate her sister\\'s death, giving Sara more momentum to carry on. \\n Throughout the Halloween Is Murder we see Sean act as the voice of reason, particularly as he doubts that Chloe was murdered. However, he knows it is often best to trust his wife\\'s instincts. \\n \"[Sean] liked to have his action plans anchored in cement.\" \\n I loved the punned Halloween-themed chapter names: \"The Grim House of Horrors\", \"Grim Reaper Claims a Victim\", \"Dreading the Boo\". \\n I liked how Sara converses with Sean simply through nods, eye movement, or minor body language. \\n \"Susannah\\'s gaze drifted to Sara, her eyes full of panic. Sara made eye contact with Sean and titled her head toward Chloe.\" \\n Narrated in the third person, Halloween Is Murder has an even-to-fast pace. Even though the characters are unsure if the mystery at hand is, in fact, a mystery, the pace isn\\'t slow. \\n It is interesting to read Halloween Is Murder, when my introduction to the cozy mystery genre was through Carolyn Arnold\\'s Coffee Is Murder (Book 9) in the McKinley Mysteries. The books are all standalones, but it was interesting to see Arnold\\'s writing style again, get cozy with the McKinley\\'s and re-live the series. \\n \"People referred to money as the almighty dollar, but she was one American who worshipped the coffee gods and the almighty bean.\" \\n I also liked Sara and Sean\\'s humanitarian side, which made the novel all the more enjoyable. \\n Halloween Is Murder is light and enjoyable, with a good cast of characters, lots of humour, and a Halloweenish-edge. \\n Overall rating: 5 stars \\n (Note: I got an Advanced Reader\\'s Copy (ARC) for Halloween Is Murder)',\n",
       " 'Intense! Is the first word that comes to mind while and after reading Lies She Told by Cate Holahan. The novel kept me on edge from start to finish. \\n Lies She Told is about Liza, a suspense writer, whose first novel becomes a bestseller, but her subsequent books barely make anything worth mentioning in her career. Now, she asks her editor for one-month extension to write a book, without an outline. \\n Added to that, Liza\\'s husband\\'s best friend and law partner, Nick, has disappeared, straining Liza\\'s relationship with her husband at a time she is looking to conceive. Things go from bad to worse when Nick\\'s body is discovered bludgeoned to death and Liza\\'s husband is arrested for his murder. \\n There are two parallel worlds in Lies She Told, the first is Liza\\'s, while the second is that of the main character in her work-in-progress, Beth, who recently had her daughter Victoria and suspects her husband is cheating on her. \\n Liza says that she bases her stories on real people, while changing their names and making a few additions. As the book progresses, the reader can\\'t help but notice how true that is. Some events are repeated, even some quotes taken out of Liza\\'s friends\\' mouths. \\n \"I don\\'t invent my characters. I steal them from my surroundings. To be a writer is to be a life thief. Every day, I rob myself blind.\" \\n I enjoyed the parallelism between the two worlds. Liza makes up for what she doesn\\'t have through Beth. When the novel begins, we learn that Liza is taking experimental drugs to conceive; in the story, Beth has done the same but was able to have Victoria. Similarly, Liza\\'s mother passed away, but Beth\\'s is alive and well. \\n I liked the development of Beth\\'s character, which, in a way, is reminiscent of Nora in Henrik Ibsen\\'s The Doll House. \\n Bit by bit, Beth begins invading Liza\\'s world, making comments in her, or rather Liza thinks what Beth would say in certain situations. Sometimes, Liza attempts to shut her character out of her head, and other times, Beth reprimands her author for her decisions. I liked this a lot, as well as the arguments between Liza and her character. \\n \"I\\'ve created a character that would be far more adept in this situation than I am. I need to think like her.\" \\n I couldn\\'t tell if the pace in Lies She Told was fast or slow because of the constant suspense. I also liked the use of quotes at the beginning of the book, and at other parts in the book. \\n There are many memorable and beautiful quotes, images, and phrases throughout the book. The dialogue is nicely included in both narratives. I liked Liza\\'s notes on writing, which can act as writing tips to readers and writers in general. \\n \"My emotions don\\'t vacillate between happy and sad like a pianist alternating between major and minor scales. They\\'re stuck in a discordant chord.\" \\n One of the things I disliked, however, was that I felt that Jake, Beth\\'s unfaithful husband, did not get what he deserved at the end of the book. I also wanted to know if Beth\\'s story would be Liza\\'s newest bestseller. \\n Every time I put Lies She Told down, I kept trying to remind myself that both Liza and Beth were just characters, that this was all fiction. They were just too real. \\n Half-way through the book I knew this was a five-star read. Finishing it, I confirmed my expectations. Lies She Told gave me palpitations while and after reading. No book has ever done that to me! \\n Overall, Cate Holahan\\'s Lies She Told is a must-read psychological thriller, but it\\'s not for the faint of heart, with its constant suspense, and will give you a hard time separating fiction from reality. \\n \"Blurring fact and fantasy is my trade. I am a con artist. A prevaricator. I make up stories. So why does he think this one is real?\" \\n Note: I received an Advanced Reader\\'s Copy (ARC) of Lies She Told by Cate Holahan via Lori Great Escapes Book Tours in exchange for an honest review as part of a blog tour.',\n",
       " 'Magic, Merlin and lots of humour and mayhem, that\\'s the first thing that came to mind when I started reading Sharon Pape\\'s Magic & Mayhem. \\n A paranormal, fast-paced, hilarious cozy mystery, Magic & Mayhem opens with Kailyn Wilde adjusting to the passing of her mother and grandmother, both witches, and to becoming the only person in charge of their magick shop \"Abracadabra\". \\n Narrated from Kailyn\\'s first person perspective, the novel is full of humourous comments, descriptions and events. Set in the small town of New Camel, the mystery is revealed from the beginning when Kailyn and her aunt Tilly go to see their lawyer and find him dead. \\n \"In this town, heavy traffic was five cars lined up at a red light.\" \\n Magic & Mayhem has an assortment of wonderful - and less friendly - characters, but all of whom have a role to play. There is Kailyn, whose magic, along with that of her family, has suffered a bug of late, as well as her aunt Tilly, who reads palms - although the accuracy of her readings can be questionable. \\n Kailyn follows her mother\\'s advice and attempts to summon a familiar, a kind of animal guide believed to help witches with their magic. Instead, she discovers an old man in her basement who goes by the name of Merlin. To her and Tilly\\'s surprise - and to the reader\\'s - the great wizard himself was somehow thrust forward in time from the Middle Ages to Kailyn\\'s storeroom. \\n \"Did this man really expect me to believe he was the legendary wizard? He looked more like a Don Quixote wannabe.\" \\n One of the funniest and most entertaining aspects about Magic & Mayhem is Merlin\\'s adjustment to and discovery of the gadgets of the modern world, from the toilet to the iPod to pizza. \\n I loved the references to books and movies, as well as all the magic and witch-related terminology which gave Magic & Mayhem a truly magical feel. It made me feel I was part of the story. The overall word choice of the novel was perfect and the narration was highly enjoyable. The imagery was interesting and impeccable throughout. I have never seen so many perfectly-worded similes in one place. \\n \"The kettle had gone from whistling to screeching like a banshee, by the time I plucked it off the stove. Merlin stood in the middle of the kitchen, rotating like a clumsy ballerina.\" \\n After the discovery of the dead body, Kailyn begins her own investigation and several townspeople attempt to help her in any way they can, whether through throwing gossip her way or through actual help. Kailyn\\'s curiosity is commendable, especially after she begins receiving death threats, and with the fact that the best suspect for the murder is her best friend Elise. \\n \"There was no telling what would happen to history if Merlin died in the twenty-first century. It was bad enough that he would return to his time babbling about computers, aircraft, and men on the moon.\" \\n As a cozy mystery, Magic & Mayhem fits all the characteristics, having a fair share of quirky characters, cats and a well-penned mystery. I liked how romance did not play a major - or even minor - role in the novel. \\n Characterisation and setting were among the aspects that drew me in to the novel as well. Each character was well defined and the setting was realistic. Coupled with the fast pace of the novel, I couldn\\'t put the book down. \\n Almost before I was half way through the novel did I expect to give it a five-star rating. Having finished, I\\'d definitely give it 10 stars and can\\'t wait to get my hands on the second instalment in the Abracadabra Mystery Series by Sharon Pape. A must-read at all costs. \\n \"If we ever figured out how to send him home, it might to be with a pizza oven.\" \\n Note: I received a free copy of Magick & Mayhem by Sharon Pape in exchange for an honest review as part of a blog tour with Lori Great Escapes Virtual Book Tours.',\n",
       " '\"The empty window frames like dark forest lakes conveyed chilling secrets. It seemed as if the massive wooden doors were nailed shut in order to keep them from spilling too much information.\" \\n The Steps by Latvian author Iveta Redliha is a gripping but heartbreaking story centered around people who lived or were connected to a property called The Bradbury. \\n Leonora, a fresh-out-of-school greedy graduate who is secretly hired to become a surrogate mother. She views the opportunity as easy money, and posh living and lies her way through to get the job. She thinks she will have the time of her life partying, but soon realises that her dreams will not come true as the family she\\'s being a surrogate for insist that she live on their premises, the Bradbury, for the duration of the pregnancy and under their rules and supervision. \\n Kurt and Nelly are a married couple who have been unable to conceive. They hire Leonora through a surrogacy programme to carry their baby. The moment the three of them arrive at the Bradbury, the reader meets Greta, their maid and helper, whom Leonora immediately despises and mistreats. \\n Meanwhile, Reyna receives a phone call, telling her that her mother has died. The investigation soon dries up after it is discovered that her mother died of a heart attack and not murdered. However, things don\\'t add up to Reyna. Her mother had left their shared tea shop without closing down and had been meeting with an unknown man. \\n When Reyna receives the will, she discovers that her mother had been keeping secrets, including recently purchasing the Bradbury mansion. When she visits the run-down house, she encounters Lucas, a secretive but handsome man, who entices her from the first moment. \\n \"Shivers ran down Reyna\\'s spine. For a moment, she thought his last words were meant as a threat. The stranger\\'s look had been so sharp and penetrating, horrifying and exciting at the same time.\" \\n Lucas, on the other hand, appears to despise Reyna, even though he has never met her before. However, bit by bit, he too begins to develop feelings for her. Lucas is a little reminiscent of Heathcliff from Emily Bronte\\'s Wuthering Heights, except that The Steps is a much better and more exciting book. \\n The Steps is gripping from the start. Its pace is fast, especially as the author jumps between scenes and characters without being all over the place. \\n I felt that Reyna was too gullible and very trusting, particularly of strangers. She was also a bit slow, and while I realise that the purpose of her slowness is to confirm the reader\\'s suspicions or unveil new information for the reader, I still felt she could have been a little smarter, especially since she\\'s not a child. \\n I like that there are no superfluous characters in The Steps. Each character has a role to play, including the quirky, helpful and ever-giggling Lucy. Sometimes the reader wonders if she\\'s crazy, but she is definitely the main source of comic relief in the novel. \\n Another character in the novel is Greta, the Bradbury\\'s maidservant. What I liked about her is that she has her moments. In addition to always keeping tabs on Leonora, she sometimes even makes Leonora think and wake up from her attempts at seducing Kurt. \\n Lucas strikes the reader as a calculating character from the start. I like how Iveta Redliha give the reader bits from Lucas\\' thoughts, making excellent opportunity for suspense, especially since he does not mean Reyna well and the reader has no idea why he feel such animosity to someone Lucas has never met. \\n I liked how Iveta Redliha kept me guessing, connecting the dots, then guessing all over again. \\n The Steps handles a variety of themes like family, marital relationships, greed and growing up. I like how the author made the characters progress differently. Not all of them move forward, but all the main ones had some sort of character development, particularly Leonora. \\n One of the few things that bothered me about The Steps was the speech. There was no use of quotation marks. Instead every line begun with a dash, and there were intermittent dashes in between, making it hard to follow on who is speaking and what is part of the characters\\' thoughts. \\n Some chapters were rather long, particularly at the beginning. I don\\'t like stopping mid-chapter. \\n I liked the use of imagery, both metaphors and similes throughout the novel. The description of the setting is quite picturesque and nicely done as well. \\n \"Once their eyes locked, they couldn\\'t look away, the gaze of their blue and grey waters merging into one whirlpool.\" \\n The Steps is full of irony, role reversals and all the literary elements a reader can dream of. Simply brilliant. \\n I couldn\\'t put the The Steps down, and when I wasn\\'t reading, I kept thinking of the characters. When I finished reading, I couldn\\'t stop thinking about them. \\n \"A quiet noise, like a moan or a sigh broke the silence thus startling the visitors. Lucas took it as a sign that the old building was weeping with him. If only he were alone and could let loose his suppressed grief about the house, once a beautiful home, turned into an abandoned shack, just like his soul, like his whole life...\" \\n I liked how Iveta Redliha tied up all the loose ends at the end and I was glad I was able to correctly guess many if not all of them. \\n Overall, The Steps is a suspenseful, heart-breaking, gripping dark tale of a house and its inhabitants. A 10-star must-read.',\n",
       " 'Murder by the Book by Devorah Fox is a short cozy mystery and exciting novella, and what I hope would be the first in a series. \\n The main character Candy is an average person, who is seen by her colleagues as naive and sheltered. \\n She goes to work one morning to discover her boss dead on his desk. After she calls the police and other work colleagues start filing in, Candy begins to see that her boss was not simply mean but that almost each of her colleagues had a reason to want him dead. \\n \"No sign of forced entry. No sign of a struggle. Seems to me it had to be done by someone who could just walk into his office, pick up the letter opener, and get close enough to him to stab him. That\\'d be you, wouldn\\'t it?\" \\n Candy has a sarcastic side, that is very realistic especially about the work place. We are told that Candy is always the first one in the office every morning. \\n \"The door to her boss\\'s office was ajar. Sleink himself in early? Incredible, Candy thought.\" \\n Her conversations with each of them, and the way each worker in the hotel expects another to have committed the murder, open her eyes to the dark side of her - now - former boss. \\n I related to Candy immediately after I discovered she was a bookworm with an interest in mystery novels. \\n \"Innocent or guilty, the accused in the mystery novels she read always \"swore\" that they didn\\'t do it. Candy never found that particularly convincing and yet here she just did the same thing.\" \\n The novella is too short for much character development, but at least Candy has had to learn the truth about her boss and all her colleagues, although most truths weren\\'t nice ones. There may also be a possible romance with the new police officer, Petrowski. \\n Murder by the Book is an interesting book title. I particularly liked how Candy and Petrowski solved the murder. \\n \"The alcohol in Edna\\'s breath told Candy that the woman had more likely spent the morning with Jim Beam than with Earl Grey.\" \\n Murder by the Book is a highly recommended novella by Devorah Fox, a first time author for me, but definitely not a last time one. \\n Overall rating: 4.5 stars \\n Note: I received a free copy of Murder by the Book via Escape with Lori\\'s Virtual Book Tours in exchange for an honest review as a part of a blog tour for the book.',\n",
       " '\"I was going to jail. \\n Worse my arch nemesis would be the one to drag me from my own paranormal museum.\" \\n Pressed to Death by Kirsten Weiss starts with the above lines; the cozy, possibly paranormal mystery novel is exciting, quick-paced and fun. \\n Maddie, the present owner of San Benedetto\\'s Paranormal Museum, is the unlucky person who discovers the body of a man ahead of wine festival. To make things worse, the same man had accused her of stealing his antique grape press and told the police as much. \\n Maddie is then forced/asked - which ever you decide - to investigate the man\\'s murder, with her former school nemesis Laurel Hammer being right on her tail and constantly trying to drag her to jail, especially after Maddie accidentally set Hammer\\'s hair on fire. \\n While investigating, Maddie can\\'t help but notice that her mother is acting strangely and so is her mother\\'s entire group, the Ladies\\' Aid. \\n \"It was one thing for me to discover a dead body, another to suspect my mom had some knowledge of the crime.\" \\n After the discovery of the dead body, a Romeo Paganini, Maddie keeps telling herself that she wouldn\\'t interfere with the investigation, especially after the last one nearly got her killed. \\n \"This investigation--\" \\n \"I\\'m not going to interfere.\" \\n \"Oh yes you are, Madelyn.\" \\n As with the previous book, Pressed to Death sees Maddie investigating a case that is supposed to be the police\\'s responsibility as well as a historical cold case pertaining to her recently-acquired antique grape press. \\n A relatable character, I absolutely loved Maddie, even more than in the first book in the series. She has a strong sense of what is right and what is wrong, even if that means that her actions will hurt her. She is also caring, has good instincts and has learnt to trust them. This is significant for her character development. \\n Narrated from the first person perspective of Maddie, Pressed to Death allows the reader to see how Maddie\\'s mind works as an amateur sleuth, and engrosses the reader in the novel, the events and the mystery-ies. \\n \"Haven\\'t you ever seen something you can\\'t explain?\" \\n \"Yeah, the way people tend to drop dead in your vicinity, and it\\'s never your fault.\" \\n There were a lot of beautiful lines and images in the novel. The characters are down-to-earth and I liked the friendship Maddie, Harper and Adele have. \\n \"I wanted to evoke the romance and mystery of tea, using lush descriptive phrases.\" \\n \"Lush? These are pornographic,\" Harper said. \"No wonder people were snatching them up.\" \\n Pressed to Death is the second instalment in The Perfectly Proper Paranormal Museum series, but can be easily read as a standalone novel. \\n Overall, Pressed to Death is a perfect Halloween read and enjoyable cozy mystery. \\n Overall rating: 5 stars \\n Note: I received a free copy of Pressed to Death by Kirsten Weiss in exchange for an honest review as part of a blog tour by Lori Great Escapes Book Tours.',\n",
       " 'Key to a Murder by Vicki Vass is a cozy mystery - well sort of. It does have almost all the criteria of a cozy, but the mystery aspect is significantly lacking in the novel. In fact, at some point - almost towards the third of the book - I had to go back and reread the synopsis to remember why I picked up the book in the first place. \\n The mystery is about the lantern, but until almost half the novel, there are only a few mentions of it and it is thrown to the background and is not considered a pressing matter. \\n The novel has a very strong opening with the possible ghost of Anne\\'s late Aunt Sybil, the introduction of the mystery woman who dies in Anne\\'s arms and the old Irish lantern. \\n While I liked that the mystery was not about a person specifically, but rather about an object, I didn\\'t like that I had to read chapters on food, antiques, buying and selling that didn\\'t pertain to the mystery itself. There were many chapters that I could have easily cut out because, for me, they neither moved the story nor helped the mystery. \\n There was also something in the narration. Sometimes the sentences were too short; it felt like I was hitting walls rather than full-stops. At other times, the narration felt like it was a story told to a five-year-old. So it felt out of place and irritating - throughout. \\n I did like how we got know more about Anne through her actions. She is carefree, spontaneous, and disillusioned. \\n In terms of characterisation, I couldn\\'t stand Anne. I tried, I really did. But I couldn\\'t. She\\'s a quirky character, an aspect for a cozy; however, the quirkiness makes the 40-something antique shop-owner act like a five-year-old ALL THE TIME! She\\'s immature, and impulsive. Yes, she\\'s kind. But, unbearable. \\n I did, however, like her friend CC, who I might add was the one who pretty much did all the research and \\'cracked the case\\'. Still, CC, who has a few quirks of her own, was sometimes irritating. She is a know-it-all kind of character and likes to narrate history to anyone who\\'d listen. Like Anne, I got bored of her rambles and sometimes wanted to skip some parts. \\n In a guest post by the author, published here on the blog, I discovered that Vass has a different and more enjoyable writing style. She also mentions that she lets her characters take her wherever they want - hence I would presume the chapters that for me weren\\'t needed. \\n Of the quotes and lines I liked were: \"Old farmhouses in the middle of nowhere on rainy nights were better left to cozy mysteries than real life.\" \\n \"CC half expected to see a hobbit answer the door when she knocked. The woman who answered was a bit taller than a hobbit but not by much.\" \\n One of the reasons I finished the book was to see if the unraveling of the mystery would WOW me or not. It ended up being a bit complex but the mystery-solving came in the last third of the novel. It was also rather rushed, like \"oh my the novel is about to end and I haven\\'t solved the mystery yet!\" \\n By p. 159 (that\\'s 75% through), there was at last some development! I thought the novel would end while the mystery remained in the trunk of the car. \\n The conversations between the characters were mostly basic, bits that can be skipped. Some were too long and useless. \\n I liked that there was a good bit of a historical background, making the novel a historical fiction cozy. \\n Of all the notes I kept writing throughout Key to a Murder, was pointing out how immature Anne was and how many of the events don\\'t lead to anything. \\n The good side about reading this novel was learning a few tricks for my own writing. \\n My overall rating for Key to a Murder is 1.5-2 stars. \\n I had high hopes for this novella, most of which didn\\'t come through. \\n Note: I received a free copy of Key to a Murder by Vicki Vass in exchange for an honest review with Lori Great Escapes Virtual Book Tours. But since my review is less than 3 stars, I opted to keep it till after the tour was over. \\n I\\'m honest and I don\\'t hold back on what I like or dislike about a book. But it wouldn\\'t have been fair to post this review as part of a promotional tour. \\n I would, however, recommend you read the guest post by Vicki Vass, titled \"Blurring the Lines between Reality and Fiction\". \\n http://nadanessinmotion.blogspot.com....',\n",
       " 'Didn\\'t see this one coming! \\n The Corpse with the Ruby Lips by Cathy Ace is a new instalment in the Cait Morgan Mystery Series, and a different mystery by all means. \\n In her books, Ace often takes the reader to a foreign country. In The Corpse with the Garnet Face, the country of choice was Amsterdam, the Netherlands. In this instalment, the novel is set in Budapest, Hungary. \\n Cait goes to Budapest to teach for a month; there one of her students, Zsofia, asks that she look into her grandmother\\'s death which occurred almost 40 years prior on Cait\\'s university campus at UVAN (University of Vancouver). \\n As Cait begins to meet other family members, exercising her psychology tactics and having her husband Bud, who had to remain in Canada, dig into the unclosed mystery, things begin to spiral in a new direction, as the case opens fresh wounds for many. \\n One of the things I liked about this instalment was Ace\\'s use of books, a saga to be exact, that might mirror what has happened to the family. The author also handles a variety of themes and problems such as Alzheimer\\'s and alcoholism, to keep Cait - and the reader - away from finding the truth. \\n Regarding alcoholism, Ace carefully utilises the problems accompanied with it in the book and characters. \\n Having lived with a person whose memory was often ravaged by too much liquor, I recognised the expression that flashed across Alexa\\'s face; she couldn\\'t recall exactly what she\\'d said to her daughter the night before, and experience was telling her she\\'d never be able to retrieve the lost words from the black hole where they\\'d sunk without trace. \\n The Corpse with the Ruby Lips is quite realistic; I particularly liked how the renowned psychologist Cait isn\\'t perfect and despite her intelligence can be gullible at times. \\n I was speechless. She\\'d used me! She\\'d researched me, found my weaknesses, and just plain used me. And I\\'d fallen for it. I\\'d actually liked her. \\n As always, Cait\\'s little insights never fail to impress me. I particularly liked this part where she describes a music manager who had come to look at new artists and sign them up. Cait\\'s emotions are clear and easily transferred to the reader. \\n He handed out cards, his fingers lingering on Zsofia\\'s as she took one. I felt everything in me clench - not just because of the way his eyes were sliding across Zsofia\\'s bosom, but because the way he presented himself wasn\\'t endearing at all; there\\'s only so much bling a person can wear before you begin to wonder why they need to have that much gold about their person at all times. \\n The book is not devoid of humour and bit of sarcasm. \\n \"\\'Careful\\' is my middle name,\" I mugged. \\n \"Not it\\'s not, and it never will be. Your middle name\\'s much more likely to be \\'catastrophe.\\'\" \\n Narrated in the first person, The Corpse with the Ruby Lips has many beautiful lines, imagery and quotes. The overall narration is exciting, even when events don\\'t seem to be moving forward. \\n \"Words can never be unsaid. They ring in our ears forever - sometimes when we least want them to.\" \\n Overall rating: 5 stars. \\n Note: This review was originally part of a blog tour with Lori Great Escapes Virtual Book Tours, but due to commitments I was only able to publish the guest post titled \"The Effect of Words\" by Cathy Ace on my scheduled date. Check out the post highlighting the theme of \\'words\\' in The Corpse with the Ruby Lips: http://nadanessinmotion.blogspot.com....',\n",
       " 'Stake Out by Lily Luchesi is the first paranormal, romance and crime novella in the Paranormal Detectives series. \\n Easily read in one sitting, the book is fast-paced, action-packed and highly enjoyable. \\n It opens with detective Daniel - Danny - Mancini surviving an encounter with a man named Vincent, whom we learn is a 200-year old vampire. After submitting his report of the incident, Danny is forced into an early retirement. Two years later, he is approached by a beautiful young-looking woman, claiming she is from a lesser known FBI division called the Paranormal Investigative Division (PID). \\n The woman, Angelica, tells Daniel that what he had seen two years prior was true and that the PID is responsible for weeding out dangerous paranormal creatures, like Vincent. Danny struggles to come to terms with these revelations, but accepts to help Angelica catch the rogue vampire. The two slowly become attracted to one another, igniting a bit of a romance, which has deeper roots than the reader expects. \\n Stake Out is fairly gritty but nonetheless exciting with likeable characters. I liked how the reader got the viewpoints and flashbacks of various characters throughout the book. \\n \"He also knew that Angelica would personally kill him if he did anything to compromise the investigation. Her body might be 24, but her mind was older and more cunning than even Gandalf!\" \\n One of the things I liked about the novella was the use of songs at the beginning of each chapter. It added a gothic feel to the book. \\n I liked how Luchesi was to the point in the novella, while also keeping the reader on edge by feeding us bits and pieces of history about Angelica, Vincent and even Danny and the PID. I also liked how she had me guessing at events, many of which proved true and others I had to wait for the revelation. \\n I also liked how Stake Out has a closed and open ending at the same time, prompting the reader to want to know what happens in later books. \\n Overall, Stake Out kept me glued to the Kindle screen till I finished it. \\n Overall rating is 5 stars. I definitely would love to pick up the next books in the series.',\n",
       " 'The Book Club Murders by Leslie Nagel is the first instalment in The Oakwood Mystery Series. And damn that was a super-paced good read, perfect for a bibliophile and a mystery lover! \\n The story\\'s main character Charlotte - Charley - Carpenter, the owner Old Hat, a clothing store, is part of a reading group focused around mysteries. She joins the rich-women\\'s book club with the ulterior motive of attracting buyers to her vintage shop. \\n The book opens with the scheduled books to be read between August and December. The group of 8, called the Agathas Book Club, with each member labelled \"an Agatha\", tackles a book each month. Set in the small town of Oakwood, Ohio, the book also opens with the shocking revelation of a murder. \\n The Agathas are shocked to discover that the victim is an acquaintance. They also realise that the victim was positioned in a way that reflects the murder of the book they were reading. Soon after, another dead body emerges, also linked to the book club members. \\n \"Most of the Agathas seemed to be enjoying themselves, as if the poor woman had been killed for their entertainment. Be honest, Carpenter. You\\'re just as curious as the rest of them.\" \\n Each character in the novel has a role to play: corpse, amateur sleuth, killer, suspect, police officer, helping hand. \\n The detective investigating the killings is not-an-old-friend of Charley, but her high school crush Marcus Trenault. As soon as they meet, old love and trouble are rekindled. As the two suspect that the killings are done by a woman, Charley suggests that they are likely to have been committed by an Agatha and convinces Marc to use her as an informant to infiltrate the Book Club. \\n \"Don\\'t be fooled by the expensive armour, most of these women are scared to death, usually of one another.\" \\n Charley is a fun, slightly sarcastic character. She smart, brave and passionate. She\\'s also realistic and down to earth. At one point, she faces Marcus and tells him: \"You owe me an apology.\" \\n I felt that The Book Club Murders was more crime and sleuthing than plain cozy mystery. I loved it nonetheless and would definitely pick up the next books in the series. I also enjoyed the romance aspect of the novel. \\n The imagery and emotions in the novel were well-written, with lots of \"show don\\'t tell\". \\n I absolutely loved the mystery-book references and how the author brought in published mystery novels and used them in the murders. This book will have me picking up several mystery novels and adding them to my lengthy - possibly never-ending - to-be-read list. \\n \"No one is going to believe that for a second. Look, this is the twenty-first century. Everyone watches CSI and Law & Order or whatever. If you start asking questions about who left when, and did you notice anyone acting suspiciously, how long do you think it\\'s going to take before people figure out what you\\'re really up to?\" \\n And the mystery... that was plain wicked! \\n Note: I received a free advanced readers\\' copy (ARC) of The Book Club Murders by Leslie Nagel as part of a blog tour via Lori Great Escapes Virtual Book Tours, in exchange for an honest review.',\n",
       " 'Note: I received a free copy of Riker\\'s Calling from its author in exchange for an honest - overdue - review. \\n Riker\\'s Calling by Rico Lamoureux is fast-paced thrilling crime-mystery novella with a mastermind of a villain. Brilliantly wicked! \\n Bullied in his teens, 21-year-old Jeremy Riker looks to become a police officer to do some good and stop bullies. But an injury renders him slightly deformed and obliterates his dreams of joining law enforcement. Despite extensive training, he is denied the opportunity to join law enforcement several times. So he becomes a kind of vigilante and considers opening his own private investigations (P.I.) firm with his friend and mentor Max. \\n Highly trained in martial arts, spotting bad guys, and a host of other skills, Riker is seen as the perfect person for law enforcement despite his injury. \\n \"I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that the past several hours had been anything but random. Someone out there knew my history.\" \\n Unknown to Riker, a killer, named The Spyderco Killer because of the Spyderco (a kind of knife) he leaves in his victims\\' backs, has set his eyes on him but continuously eludes him, until he - the killer - decides to go on a killing spree, hitting close to home for Riker. \\n Although the novella is called Riker\\'s Calling, there are only two instances where the narration is from Riker\\'s perspective. We get the killer\\'s views, movement, and action, but in the third person. \\n One of the things I liked about Riker\\'s Calling is Lamoureux\\'s way of giving the reader information through a variety of sources such as a news anchor, tweets, and people talking about events. We even get bits of Riker\\'s history from the killer\\'s perspective. \\n I thought the novel was a bit gritty at times, especially since the killer slashed his victims\\' throats but there was a little more than just throat slashing. \\n \"Fifteen cigars - nine with red bands, to represent the past nine years of silence and therefore the nine victims to come, and six with yellow bands, for any collateral damage that might occur.\" \\n The novel spans almost two decades but starts in the present time with bits of flashbacks and Riker and the killer playing cat and mouse. \\n I liked Riker\\'s narration, especially how relatable he was, using examples from crime series like Law & Order, and mentioning notes on crimes and criminals. The irony in the novella was mind-blowing at times! \\n Overall, Riker\\'s Calling is meticulously connected; it\\'s brilliant! Lamoureux is lauded for his twists and for creating a genius killer. It is definitely a five-star action-packed must-read. \\n \"Truth is rarely blossoming with flowers. More often than not it\\'s cold, it\\'s hard, and if you\\'re not in alignment with it, it\\'ll smash you to pieces.\"',\n",
       " 'Spider Bones is my first read for Kathy Reichs, the author behind the books that created the police/mystery TV series, Bones. \\n I must say that the series were a lot more exciting than the book. While, I\\'ve seen others comment that Spider Bones is not Reich\\'s best. I felt overall disappointed. \\n The beginning put me off as I felt that Brennan - or the author or both, I couldn\\'t tell - appeared to be showing off with her French. The novel begins in Quebec, where French is commonly used. But as a reader of English I have no need to know what each place is called in French and what it means in English. I felt it was pointless. \\n The mystery began as intriguing with a bizarre death, originally may have been ruled as some kind of mistake by a John Lowery. As the novel progresses, there seems to be a link between this case and another. As Brennan finds out that John Lowery had died in the war in Vietnam and was supposedly buried. \\n So far so good, but Brennan takes up another case in Hawaii, things get confusing, whether in switching between cases or worse when there is a possibility that the cases might be linked. \\n From there, Spider Bones takes confusing to a whole new level. There were parts that I kept rereading to figure out what I had misunderstood and others where I gave up and thought I\\'d just make it to the end - which was also confusing. \\n There were a lot of medical terminology, to the point where I felt that the book is recommended for med students or doctors, but at other times the information was simply written and informative. \\n \"Dead hearts don\\'t pump. Bleeding at a trauma site usually means the victim was alive when injured. No blood usually means the hit was taken postmortem.\" \\n I liked that Brennan was often sarcastic. I couldn\\'t be sure whether I liked or disliked her overall in the book. \\n I honestly had bigger expectations for the Spider Bones. And it is not often that a series (or movie) turns out to be better than the book. But this is such a case. \\n Overall rating: 2 stars',\n",
       " 'A continuation of the Cait Morgan Mysteries, The Corpse with the Garnet Face by Cathy Ace is a different kind of mystery. The first chapter opens with two bombshells for psychologist Cait and her new - and newly-retired cop - husband Bud Anderson, who learns from his mother, Ebba, that he had an uncle and that that uncle was now dead. \\n Cathy Ace expertly weaves in comic relief also from the first few pages to relieve the tension she built on the first page of the novel. \\n The uncle, Jonas, leaves a letter for Bud and gives him a task to uncover a long-dead mystery that took place early in Jonas\\' life. In his letter, Jonas tells Bud: \"I cannot tell you who I am. No man can do that of himself. He is only the person he is because of how people know him, and what he has done. It is time for what I have done to be understood.\" \\n When we first meet Ebba, she describes her brother, saying \"Jonas was a bad boy,\" whereas when we begin to meet Jonas\\' friends in the Netherlands, some say \"He was a good man.\" The contrast puts the reader in the middle, awaiting to find out which of them is right about the estranged uncle. \\n Cait and Bud travel to Amsterdam to fulfil Jonas\\' will and uncover a mystery if there is one. There, they learn about who Jonas was through his friends. \\n \"His facial muscles gave away almost nothing; the throbbing vein in his neck told a different tale.\" \\n Soon enough they begin to feel that the accounts given to them of Jonas are contradictory and that some of the friends seem to be hiding something. \\n One of the fun things about the Cait Morgan Series, is how Cait observes people, pointing out tiny hints about their facial expressions or tones. \"The only problem was that, although he was saying all the right words, his tone wasn\\'t utterly convincing.\" \\n The Corpse with the Garnet Face tackles art, lots of it, since Jonas and his friends were artists and painters. However, there were some parts that I felt were too detailed in the art world that a normal reader - like me - would feel lost. These parts, I felt, would be more appreciated by someone who majors in art. \\n I liked the chapter where Bud and Cait create a timeline of the events they\\'ve learned. I felt it was a bit like a nicely-written history book. \\n \"First of all, I know we\\'ve established that everyone has lied to us, and they\\'ve also tried to muddy the waters.\" \\n I did, however, feel that the conclusion to The Corpse with the Garnet Face was rather confusing, even as Cait laid out all their findings, I still felt lost. \\n Still, I liked how Cait and Bud were able to uncover not only the mystery they were sent to Holland for, but several others pertaining to Jonas\\' group. \\n The Corpse with the Garnet Face is certainly a different cozy mystery read. A mystery that produces more mysteries and keeps the reader\\'s mind working. \\n \"All I wanted to do was fulfill my uncle\\'s wishes, and be able to go back to Mom with some knowledge she could cherish about the guy. Instead, there\\'s all of this...I don\\'t know, this atmosphere of things not being what they appear to be. I don\\'t like it.\" \\n Overall rating: 4 stars \\n Note: I received a free copy of The Corpse with the Garnet Face in exchange for an honest review. \\n Check out my book review of The Corpse with the Diamond Hand here. \\n http://nadanessinmotion.blogspot.com....',\n",
       " 'Be Still My Beading Heart is a short mini-mystery novella that is part of Janice Peacock\\'s Glass Bead Mystery Series. \\n Bead maker Jax O\\'Connell goes to drop off a bead order and returns to find her car missing on Valentine\\'s Day. She sees a tow truck moving away along with the new-on-the-job cute cop. \\n The short mystery does not involve a murder, making it extra cozy and light, but the mystery is of where Jax\\'s car has disappeared to and whether or not she can get it back. \\n Jax is also lacking in the romance department. She says: \"I usually didn\\'t get much attention from the opposite sex, other than from my attitudinal cat, Gumdrop, but I don\\'t think he counts, nor does Stanley the Bassett hound. The dog snuffled into the living room at that moment, sidled up to me, and gave me a slobbery kiss on the arm. That was probably the closest thing to romance I\\'d see this Valentine\\'s Day.\" \\n The handsome Detective Zachary from High Strung, the first instalment in the series, whom Jax also thinks is hot in a Clark Kent/Superman kind of way makes an appearance. \\n At one point, Jax has to defend herself and what she uses cracked me up and I just wanted to give a thumbs-up to her and to Janice Peacock. \\n Be Still My Beading Heart is cozy and enjoyable and I highly recommend it.',\n",
       " 'Big Hair and Buttermilk Pie by Lori Stacy is the first instalment in the Rose Cottage Cafe Mysteries. \\n The book is cozy to the point where you feel like you\\'re part of the setting and the characters are your friends and I particularly enjoyed that about the novella. \\n The story opens with a prologue of a small-town Mayor and his wife and we\\'re given the idea that he may be unfaithful. The first chapter opens at the Rose Cottage Cafe owned and run by Mandy Hemphill and we, along with the Mayor\\'s wife, are informed that the Mayor has been killed and likely murdered. \\n From here, the novel begins to cover various angles of who could have killed the Mayor, while it is implied that the murder weapon may have come from Mandy\\'s kitchen. \\n \"Solve a murder? I don\\'t solve crimes, I...I bake muffins.\" \\n As Mandy tries to clear her name and find out who would want to frame her, her customer numbers keep dwindling. We learn that Mandy had submitted a request for a patio to be added to her cafe but the late Mayor had turned down her request. \\n Mandy, along with the new tenant in her building, Ben, who is resurrecting a local newspaper, begin to snoop around and ask questions, while the police continue to be anywhere but near the real culprit. \\n There isn\\'t much imagery in the novel, but the sweet treats and other foods made at the Rose Cottage Cafe make up for that. Moreover, the writing and the characters are very realistic, which makes the reader feel as though they are part of the novel. \\n \"It was hardly a secret to her staff that Mandy found baking therapeutic. It was a big part of why had chosen to go into this business in the first place. Of everything she did in her life, nothing made her feel happier and more at peace than baking.\" \\n The chapters are short and the pace is quick, prompting the reader to carry on without thinking. \\n There were a few repetitions in the novella that bugged me a bit, but overall it was a fun read. \\n I also liked that Mandy did not get the guy at the end but that after the crime was solved, all the good characters were rewarded in some way or other, like justice being served but in different ways. \\n Quick, cozy, and with many sweet treats, Big Hair and Buttermilk Pie is a quick read, that can easily be read in a day or sitting. There are also two recipes at the end of the book to complement the reader\\'s appetite for the Rose Cottage confectioneries. \\n Overall rating: 3.5 stars \\n Note: I received a free copy of the book in exchange for an honest review via Lori\\'s Great Escapes Virtual Book Tours.',\n",
       " 'Black Water Tales: The Unwanted by Jean Nicole Rivers is a horror novel set in the remote city of Borslav. It begins with Blaire Baker, who volunteers as a teacher at St. Sebastian Orphanage, who is going to meet up with another volunteer, Travis, a nurse, so they can head together to the house where they will spend a year. \\n St. Sebastian is not an ordinary orphanage. It is a place where people come to leave their \\'unwanted\\' children. \\n \"The loneliness she carried was dark and telling of a grotesque obscurity of the heart, one that haunted her every move and moment.\" \\n While there wasn\\'t much room for character development, considering that at several points in the novel, the reader thinks that Blaire may be insane or imagining things, there was a bit of development in Blaire\\'s overall perception of the world. She learns that wealth might mean nothing to her but it means a lot for others, especially the children. She starts out as wearing diamond earrings but soon discards them after realising that this is not the place for them. What she does for the children also denotes character and care, the latter being a trait that was she was denied after her parents\\' death. \\n The language in the novel was beautiful, although a bit verbose at time but overall interesting, descriptive and enjoyable. I loved the flow, and narration. The imagery too is spectacular throughout. \\n \"Blaire emerged sluggishly into consciousness like a sea-bound castaway finally trudging unto shore.\" \\n I liked how the author made the reader think that Blaire may be hallucinating or imagining things. It made me doubt that she might be the one who is psychologically unstable, with visions and a wild imagination. It also helped give a sense that the novel might be real or paranormal at some point. \\n Suspenseful and scary, Black Water Tales: The Unwanted nearly had me pick up the bad habit of nail-biting! \\n The novel is rich in characters of all ages, ideas, beliefs and all levels of creepy. \\n I like Jean Nicole\\'s use of foreshadowing and the way she gives the reader a foreboding feeling of what is to come. For example, the first description we get of the train heading for Borslav is \"It exhaled noisily as if it had been running a marathon all day. Garish dinging blared from speakers on the platform, and the doors of the train opened wide, releasing mobs that fled so furiously one could have easily assumed that this was the last stop before the end of the earth.\" \\n The short chapters helped the already fast-paced novel move even faster. \\n One of the things I really liked about Black Water Tales: The Unwanted was that it was not only a horror novel, but it also had a mystery or rather several mysteries about the place (St. Sebastian), the children and even Blaire. \\n \"Unspoken questions filled the room, like ocean water pouring into the lower decks of a sinking ship, and suddenly everyone was rushing to escape.\" \\n Black Water Tales: The Unwanted has gripping imagery, flow and storyline. It is as scary in the morning as it is at night. \\n I also particularly enjoyed Jean Nicole\\'s show-don\\'t-tell technique, as well as her ability to make the reader feel as scared, confused or any other emotion as Blaire and the other characters felt. \\n \"Borslav was no Kerchaviv. It was Chernobyl-like, miserable and secluded with the faint pulse of previous life still vibrating through its damaged carcass of crumbling buildings and forgotten items, a dismal reminder of lives left behind in the fire.\" \\n I liked how the author kept misleading the reader till the very end, making them question almost everything and doubt everyone. \\n Although the reader is left with some questions, the novel does not have an open ending. \\n Overall, Jean Nicole\\'s Black Water Tales: The Unwanted is a must-read for all. Although I recommend you don\\'t go for it before bed. \\n I literally had to turn on the lights for this one! \\n \"A feeling of dread surged through her. All eyes in the classroom grabbed [her] like hissing snakes, stretching out of their sockets, coiling around her.\"',\n",
       " 'The Story of Lucius Cane by Vanya Ferreira is a novella - or short story - introducing the ancient vampire Lucius Cane, who meets an unlikely and strange foe. \\n An introduction to a series, the story consists of a prologue and seven short chapters. \\n The novella is quite short and does not leave much room for character development. It does, however, give a good description of both Lucius Cane and his opponent. \\n The story alternates between Lucius and Jack, also known as Jack the Hound, mostly for his rugged and vicious appearance. Jack, too, has a paranormal side to him, although he is not a vampire. \\n \"He noticed that his eyesight had improved and that he could see perfectly no matter how dark, his sense of smell had become so acute he could smell a break baking at the bakers over a mile and a half away...\" \\n There is also the mystery of a secondary voice inside Lucius\\' head. Although we are told that that is for another - much longer - story. \\n \"You have to be quick about it, Lucius.\" Spoke a dusty voice but Anne did not hear it.\" \\n I like how the story unfolds. Some of it may appear as cliche, one man asked to kill another, but the ending - I definitely did not see that one coming. \\n \"One day he came to the belief that there isn\\'t anything quite as thrilling as hunting man, the most dangerous animal of all.\" \\n Overall, The Story of Lucius Cane is an interesting and quick read. It certainly makes you want to carry on with the rest of the series. \\n Overall rating: 3 stars. \\n Note: I received a free copy of The Story of Lucius Cane from the author in exchange for an honest review.',\n",
       " 'The Perfectly Proper Paranormal Museum by Kirsten Weiss is a fun possibly paranormal cozy mystery, and the first installment in a series under the same name. \\n The novel opens with Maddie Kosloski and her friend Adele, who owns the Paranormal Museum and the second half of a building, which the latter is remodeling into a tea shop. The two women are confronted with the dead body of a not-so-likable acquaintance, Christy, in chapter one. \\n Christy, it seems, had a knack for making enemies. While reading, you can\\'t feel sympathy for the dead woman. It also appears as though everyone had a motive to kill her. \\n \"Mother always told me to stay positive. But I can\\'t help feeling like another show is about to drop.\" \\n Maddie has significant faith that the police will handle the case with care and find the killer. However, she soon discovers that the school bully, Laurel Hammer, is one of the detectives in charge of the investigation, and it seems she has a grudge against Maddie. \\n The first introduction we get of Laurel, apart from reminder of Maddie\\'s friend Harper, is this: \\n \"Laurel Hammer banged open the door to the interview room. \"So which one of you two idiots killer her?\" \\n Maddie constantly tries to get people to tell the police what they know, and tries to do the same herself, but the police look at her as a likely suspect, especially when a second body appears; another fairly dislikable acquaintance. Even after they arrest her friend Adele, Maddie tries to be the good citizen and help the detectives. \\n The Perfectly Proper Paranormal Museum is narrated from the first person perspective of Maddie, who gets many funny and entertaining thoughts. She is also down to earth and realistic, so it is easy to imagine her and imagine being in her place. Also, we go deeper into her character as she hesitates about managing the Paranormal Museum, while job hunting after being fired from her previous job. \\n \"Dion Fortune\\'s scrying mirror.\" [said Herb]... \"Of course, I\\'m asking ten thousand.\" \\n I coughed. \"Dollars?\" \\n \"But for you, five.\" \\n \"Thousand?\" I wouldn\\'t pay five thousand for Ali Baba\\'s mirror. There was no way anything in the museum cost that much. \\n The overall pace is fairly quick. There is constant moving and events, but in terms of solving Christy\\'s murder, things are a bit slow. There was also the GD cat, a recurring theme in paranormal novels, although I couldn\\'t understand that cat or its intentions. \\n The Perfectly Proper Paranormal Museum is home to second mystery, one which Maddie stumbles upon, immerses herself in and takes it upon herself to solve. The mystery revolves around the picture of a woman named Cora, who is accused of murdering her husband. \\n I truly enjoyed the mystery within a mystery, and how Maddie goes about in order to search for two killers, one dead and one alive. \\n Another thing I enjoyed is how Weiss constantly made the reader think and doubt if the Paranormal Museum can live up to its name by being haunted - or not. Up until the end of the novel, the reader has doubts. \\n \"The atmosphere thickened, choking. The quiet stretched, the only sound my own harsh breath, breath I could see in the air. It was a nails on a chalkboard silence, a deep silence that tightened my throat, made me tremble.\" \\n I particularly liked the development in Maddie\\'s character, a trait not often seen in mystery novels. When we first see Maddie, she has low self-esteem, and who can blame her after nine months of job hunting with no development in getting a job. But as the novel ends, we see a significant change in her character, both in her attempt to catch the killer and in her negotiation skills. \\n The Perfectly Proper Paranormal Museum is a quick, well-written and light read, with a mystery within a mystery and possible ghost. \\n Note: I received a free copy via Lori Great Escapes Virtual Book Tours in exchange for an honest review as part of a blog tour for the book.',\n",
       " 'Note: I received a free copy from Booktrope Publishing in exchange for an honest review. \\n High Strung by Janice Peacock is the first instalment in the Glass Beads Mystery series. The novel begins with Jax O\\'Connell receiving a letter from the lawyer of her late aunt Rita, who offers to give her her house in Seattle, on the condition that she - Jax - must do what she loves. \\n The letter, contains two of the most beautiful lines in the novel: \\n \"I know inside your tired heart is a woman waiting to start living.\" Then she sets the condition, \"You must live in my house and find your creative passion. I hope my gift helps you live the life you love.\" \\n Jax accepts the offer and begins to make beads in a studio she sets at the end of Aunt Rita\\'s complex. \\n The novel is narrated from Jax\\'s first person perspective, which is fun since Jax is sarcastic, fun and very down to earth. \\n High Strung revolves around a bead makers\\' event, hosted by Rosie at her shop Aztec Beads, which includes several workshops given by various bead makers from several states. \\n Rosie is an obnoxious and domineering character. Even her dog is annoying. \\n \"Rosie was a fireplug of a woman; her dark hair, complete lack of neck, and right now the intense look of anger on her red face made her look like a very serious fireplug.\" \\n Ms. Peacock does a great job in drawing her characters, bringing them to life and making the reader feel as if they were part of the setting and the novel as a whole. It is easy to imagine characters; in fact, I felt as if I\\'d become part of the book and that going out the door I\\'d find Aztec beads and Jax around the corner. \\n Two events take place almost hours apart: Rosie is strangled by her own bead necklace and shortly after another character is killed. At first, it is unclear whether the events are connected, and later Jax and her best friend Tessa work on the how and why they may be connected. \\n Although the actual mystery does not begin till halfway through the book, High Strung was a fun read, especially since the characters had day-to-day ups and downs and interactions that would seem bizarre in real life but are believable when read. \\n The only thing I disliked about the novel was how the mystery was unfolded; it was kind of sudden in a weird way. I wanted a stronger confrontation. \\n Still, I liked how ordinary people had to run around looking for clues and interviewing their friends in order to discover who the killer was and why they did it - Don\\'t depend on \"Detective Grant\" for that. I also enjoyed Jax\\'s and Tessa\\'s analysis of what they had, the possible motives and so on. \\n I also loved the use of bead-imagery with regards to the mystery. At one point Jax tells Tessa: \"We just have to sort through the junk. You know, like organising a jumbled box of beads. All we have to do is put each piece in its proper place, and we\\'ll be able to see what we have.\" \\n In High Strung, it is clear that the author has done massive effort and research to provide explanations for the bead-making process and descriptions for the beads, which were all colourful and just made you want to see - and acquire - many of them in real life. \\n There\\'s also lots of comedy from start to finish, making it an even cozier and more enjoyable read. \\n \"I didn\\'t think an exploding cake was a reason to call 911, so I called you instead,\" Val [told Jax]. \\n \"My own animal companion was going to have a kitten (although anatomically impossible for a variety of reasons) if another animal of any kind entered his house. I was sure Gummie considered this his house, and that he let me live here simply for his own convenience, because I knew hwo to open cat food cans.\" \\n One of the best things about the novel, apart from character depth, is character development. Both protagonist Jax, and the \"fireplug\" Rosie see some development towards the end of the novel, which is rare in mystery novels in general. \\n Overall, High Strung is a fun, cozy read with beautiful characters and an interesting mystery. It is also a great start to my reading list for 2016.',\n",
       " 'Note: I received an Advanced Readers\\' Copy (ARC) of The Corpse with the Diamond in exchange for an honest review as part of a blog tour for the book via Lori\\'s Great Escapes Virtual Book Tours. \\n The Corpse with the Diamond Hand by Cathy Ace is a new stand-alone instalment in the Cait Morgan mystery series. \\n Narrated from the first person perspective of Cait Morgan, the novel is a fun, mind-provoking cozy mystery. \\n Cait and Bud Anderson have recently said their \"I do\\'s\" and are on a two-week honeymoon cruise to Hawaii, but the mystery-free getaway changes course two days before the trip is over, when Tommy Trussler, the ship\\'s card instructor drops dead on the game floor. \\n To everyone on board, it appears that Tommy died of natural causes, but to the mystery-solving psychoanalyst, the man appeared to have been poisoned. \\n As soon as the incident occurs we are introduced to Ezra Eisen, the head of security on the ship, the nurse, doctor and other ship personal, in addition to the people who were in the ship\\'s game room, each of whom has a secret to hide and a reason to kill Tommy, as Cait later discovers. \\n Cait has a special skill that has enabled her to solve crimes in the past. She literally remembers everything. However, she explains to Ezra how people perceive things, saying \"As human beings, we\\'re not capable of experiencing the world as it is - we always experience it as we are, with all our faults, flaw, preconceptions and prejudices filtering and infusing everything we perceive.\" \\n Since the novel is narrated from Cait\\'s perspective, we get her first impressions on everything. She\\'s quick to notice things, especially the slight tremors and changes in people\\'s movement or behaviour. For example, a little after Tommy dies, we meet with the captain of the ship. \\n \"But the captain\\'s micro-expressions told me he was still feeling the weight of the suspicious death on his shoulders.\" \\n One of the lines that made me smile while reading and that is interesting for people looking to enter the mystery or crime genre was something medical, to which the Rachel, the ship\\'s doctor said \"It doesn\\'t always happen, and it certainly doesn\\'t happen as often as those who create fiction would have us believe, but it seems to have happened here.\" It is both funny and ironic. \\n I liked the author\\'s use of \"show don\\'t tell\" and her ability to make the reader see, smell and connect things in her book with real life. For example, when Cait says \"My nostrils told me we were nearing the medical area,\" the reader immediately remembers the smell of anaesthesia and disinfectant. \\n Although there isn\\'t character development, as is the case with most mystery novels, yet the reader comes out enlightened about several notions and ideas in life. \\n The Corpse with the Diamond was not free of gala dinners, elegant dresses, tasty food, that had me wishing to go on a cruise ship, and confrontations. \\n I enjoyed Cait\\'s comments to herself as well as her quick assessments and body language readings of others. The novel was fairly-paced. Although it covers a period of two days, still I felt the ship\\'s passengers were doing \"a lot\" in those two days. \\n I also liked how the author managed to make every character have a motive and I enjoyed the gathering they had where Cait drew out the perpetrator(s). \\n Finally, I was intrigued by the pun in the name of the book The Corpse with the Diamond, but I\\'ll leave it at that and that it had me going in another direction. \\n \"Experience changes us all...Sometimes it hits us like a wall, so vast we cannot fail to acknowledge it. Other times it seeps through the cracks in our daily lives until we accommodate it, almost without noticing. But it changes us all.\" \\n As part of the blog tour with Lori\\'s Great Escapes Virtual Book Tours, there is an ongoing giveaway.

       " 'Note: I received a free copy of Initiated to Kill from author Sharlene Almond in exchange for an honest review. \\n Initiated to Kill by Sharlene Almond is a historical thriller and mystery alternating between modern day Spain and late 19th century Britain, the time of the notorious Jack the Ripper. \\n The book is good but not a light read; the reader has to be one that doesn\\'t mind being confused at times. \\n There are two types of narration in the novel, third person for recounting events and sometimes the thoughts of certain characters, as well as the first person for who we later discover is Annabella, a student at Seville University. There are also letters written by Jack the Ripper. \\n Annabella has a scar on the back of her neck, while she doesn\\'t have complete memory of how she got the scar; she knows that on that day she lost her ability to hear. \\n There are several mysteries in Initiated to Kill, some are major and some minor. Sharlene Almond constantly gives the reader bread crumbs of information, keeping the novel interesting at all times. \\n One of the things I enjoyed about the novel was Annabella\\'s insights. Being deaf, she has to rely on her other instincts and observations of facial expressions, enabling her to decipher more than what people actually hear. She is able to decipher tiny gestures that can easily be invisible to the average person but not to her. \\n I also liked the short chapters in Initiated to Kill, which, along with pace, help the novel progress quickly especially since it\\'s a long novel. \\n \"But now, something was approaching. Some that felt like a train hurtling along the tracks, unable to stop or slow down. A train that would end in a wreck, lives ruined and lives lost.\" \\n The novel opens with a scene from the past related to masonic events and rituals. Shortly after, we are introduced to the mystery of a missing girl and the detectives Valero and Rivero, who despite trying hard to find the culprit(s), are always a step or two behind. \\n Until chapter 87, the perpetrator is a mystery, only referred to as \"he\" and \"him\". From one side, the investigators don\\'t know who he is, and from the other, we as readers see him luring the girls, who see him as someone they trust but we don\\'t get his name. \\n The novel has a lot of characters, but each of them has a role to play. At first, I thought there was no need to mention the names of the prostitutes from the Jack the Ripper scenes, but later I realised that these names were the actual names of the victims from that period, highlighting the historical aspect of the novel. \\n \"A glass smashed, a door banged closed. Silence filled her ears. An unwanted tear ran down her cheek. She peered at the sun, wishing the magic that would turn the moon to the sun would take her away. But nothing would rescue her, and she could not leave.\" \\n Usually when the reader feels that an answer to one of the many questions has been revealed, several more arise. \\n One of the things that didn\\'t go well with me in Initiated to Kill was the going to and back in the timeline. There is the time of Jack the Ripper, which is clear, but there are references to Annabella\\'s childhood, other events in the past and events in the present. There is a lot of jumping between the present and the past, which in turn is divided into several periods, some are from the late 1800s and some are from the 20th and 21st centuries. \\n I would have preferred that the going in back in time parts were clearer, especially for Annabella and in order: 1999, 2000, 2001 and so on. \\n I also did not enjoy not knowing who was speaking or who the character in front of me was in several chapters. There was a lot of he/she that caused more confusion than suspense - for me at least. \\n Once the reader feels they\\'ve got a grip on things, the author catapults us backwards or forwards in time and things become confusing once more. \\n \"Another night of dreams left a nauseous feeling in my gut. That something was going to happen. I never believed in psychics, never believed I had any ability. But the overwhelming sense that something bad was going to happen intensified every night.\" \\n An interesting and new element in Initiated to Kill was the introduction of a new character towards the end of the novel, which added to the mystery and overgrowing list of suspicious characters. \\n The overall pace of the novel is quick, but it picks up significantly towards the end with a lot of action and chasing of the culprits or more victims. However, this rise in pace brings in additional confusion, especially when the police discover that there seems to be several perps. \\n My copy has several typos and spelling mistakes - that bothered me, a lot. There was also a lot of repetition in certain places like: \\n \"Stepping back, he allowed them into his spacious office. Mahogany furniture dominated the spacious office.\" \\n Furthermore, two other mysteries arise at the end of the novel, namely: the identity of Annabella\\'s father and the reason why the perpetrator wants her dead. \\n I both liked and disliked Almond\\'s way of leading - or misleading - the reader in thinking who the perpetrator is and guessing at other events and character in the novel. \\n \"Celestina\\'s absence was like a hot coal refusing to extinguish.\" \\n A reader of Initiated to Kill would also need to be strong enough to handle some gritty and grotesque scenes, particularly those related to Jack the Ripper. The novel also requires a lot of patience and thinking. It\\'s not a book you can read before you go to sleep (it\\'s gritty in some parts) and it needs someone who is alert and ready to think. \\n Sharlene Almond is applauded for the massive amounts of research carried out for Initiated to Kill, as well as the beautiful descriptions used with a variety of places, especially the University of Seville. \\n The confusion aspect in the novel was tiresome for me; hence, my overall rating is 3 stars. \\n Note: Although I finished this novel a couple of months ago, it\\'s taken me a while to write my review due to the complexity of the novel and the massive amount of bookmarks and notes I\\'ve put in and written. (My apologies for the delay).',\n",
       " \"Note: I received a free copy of A Charming Fatality in exchange for an honest review via a blog tour with Lori's Great Escapes Book Tours. \\n Note II: There is a giveaway as part of the tour for a copy of A Charming Fatality, check it out here: \\n http://nadanessinmotion.blogspot.com/... \\n A Charming Fatality is the seventh instalment in The Magical Cures Mysteries by Tonya Kappes. Spiritualist-witch June Heal, who owns a small cures shop in Whispering Falls, is on her way to see one of her products sold outside her village, which is depending on her sales to boost its own economy. Whispering Falls is village of witches, each owns a shop that caters to their powers and abilities. \\n June, owner of A Charming Cure, senses her customers' troubles and designs the perfect lotion, cream or potion for them. Tiffany, a customer who came in during Christmas, sees June's stress-free lotion as the saviour to her business, Heat To Toe Works. However, problems arise on June's first day and soon after, Tiffany's husband and co-owner of the business is discovered dead on June's product belt at the factory. \\n Although the book is the seventh in the series, each can be read as a standalone. In the opening scene, I felt I was bombarded with the characters from Whispering Falls and their shops, which I thought could come in later because I would never remember who was in charge of what. \\n There are several plot lines in the story. There is the murder-mystery, June's upcoming marriage to Oscar, which doesn't seem to be going as smoothly as it should, and a break-in and theft in June's shop. \\n June, along with her cat or fairy god-cat Mr. Prince Charming, stick their noses in the murder mystery to find out who is bent on stopping June's project and dream. Meanwhile, June's and Oscar's aunts are working hard to get a date set for the wedding, thus, pressuring June. \\n At one point, we discover that the marriage is an arranged one, giving June doubts. Both her parents are gone, so she starts to suspect if she's been tricked into falling in love with Oscar. \\n A Charming Fatality is a fast-paced cozy magical-mystery novella. It's my first mystery in the paranormal genre. \\n There were parts, especially regarding June and Oscar's relationship that I didn't feel much, or felt they could be improved but the overall mystery, clues and resolution are absolutely five stars. \\n Kappes skillfully leads her readers across a wide range of suspects, only to unfoil something - or someone - else entirely at the end and that was a well-done job for me. \\n The novel is narrated in the first person from June's perspective and we get her emotions, worries and hopes. It is clear she is caring and the whole Head To Toe Works move is stressful for her, not only because she wants to help people, but because she feels that she needs to help her village's economy; it is the first time anyone from Whispering Falls receives an offer to go out into the mortal world. \\n In terms of comic relief, A Charming Fatality is generally light. There was a scene with two sisters and an ostrich that was really funny but totally out of place in terms of tension-and-relief. \\n Overall, A Charming Fatality was a quick, different and enjoyable read. Although not everything clicked with me, I truly enjoyed how Kappes unfoiled the mystery and ended the story and that's the most important aspect of a mystery; a good-crafted one.\",\n",
       " 'Coffee Is Murder by Carolyn Arnold is my first cozy mystery, whereas I\\'m not sure I totally get the cozy part, I must say I enjoyed the well-crafted mystery. \\n Arnold makes several social comments that are well-weaved throughout her novel. Her protagonists, Sara and Sean, were average people who became billionaires. They were also former police officers, so investigation comes naturally to them and they do it well. Sean and Sara open up a company to investigate cases that the police do not find worthy or grounded, like Sophie\\'s. Their firm depends on one rule, which is that their clients must give the fees to charity. \\n Sophie believes her mother died of cyanide poisoning through her coffee; Sara being a heavy coffee-drinker starts to keep her distance from at least coffees of the company in question, Tasty Beans. Sophie also tells the couple that her mother may not have been targeted. \\n \"I never said she was targeted, but I do believe she was murdered,\" which makes it rather difficult for the group as this is only a hunch and they have to widen their investigation. \\n The investigation/private-eye firm includes another former police officer, Jimmy, and computer whiz Adam. \\n Coffee Is Murder moves slowly at first, as pair seeks to test the coffee, but picks up once they try to work at Tasty Beans. Nonetheless, it remains interesting, with obstacles coming up here and there. \\n Jimmy, the third former police officer, is quite sarcastic and funny. He adds a lot of comic relief to the novel, especially when he goes to work for the coffee maker. \\n One of the things I liked about Coffee Is Murder is how the writer shows that all the clues might lead to a particular culprit but that may or may not be the right one. \\n Although mysteries do not have much character development, we see Sara and Sean\\'s relationship sort of get stronger. They are married couple and they care for each other but the job sometimes requires sacrifices. At one point Sara might need to drink from the coffee and she is unsure if it has been poisoned at the time or not. \\n The investigation firm does not have a name and while mulling the name after solving the case, their secretary, Helen, offers an excellent suggestion. \\n The chapters of Coffee Is Murder are quite short, making the read a lot quicker. \\n Overall, the novel is entertaining and fun. It does not deal with anything creepy like rape as other mysteries do. It is by all means a light, engaging and enjoyable novella. \\n Check out the first chapter of the novella here as well as contact details for the author: \\n http://nadanessinmotion.blogspot.com/... \\n Note: I received a free advanced reader\\'s copy (ARC) in exchange for an honest review and as part of a blog tour with Lori\\'s Great Escapes Virtual Book Tours.',\n",
       " 'Note: I received a free copy from the author in exchange for an honest review. \\n The Sham by Ellen Allen is a very heavy read. And while I don\\'t like to use the word \\'very\\', this book is by no means a light or quick read. \\n The novel is about Emily, a seventeen year-old girl, who meets an eccentric boy called Jack, whose body is constantly failing and who thinks \"they\" are after him. Soon after, dead bodies start to appear and Jack is the main suspect. The deaths remind Emily of her friend Grace, who passed away before she moved to The Sham. \\n The book opens with Emily walking her little sister. They come across a group of four girls, taunting and bullying a little boy. The scene is quite descriptive and not for the faint of heart. Jack suddenly appears and attempts to rescue the little boy, Charlie, from the bullies. \\n Emily and Jack hit it off soon after and bit by bit become close friends, and boy and girl friend. The dead bodies that begin to appear afterwards are those of the four bullies from the first chapter. \\n The pace of the novel is really slow; it picks up in some areas, but even then it is slow compared to other books. Even though there is a mystery, I felt it was a there in the background but the focus was on Emily and Jack and their relationship to the killings. \\n Although The Sham is highly emotional, it is rather tiresome, or at least it was so for me. At one point, I felt like I didn\\'t want to continue reading, and it took me nearly two months to finish the book, simply because I felt there wasn\\'t much progress, like I was reading but not moving forward. I did want to resolve the mystery, and discover who Jack was. \\n Throughout the novel, Emily feels responsible for protecting Jack, who is not very forthcoming when it comes to information about himself, but at the same time cannot help but wonder if her boyfriend is the killer. There are two investigators, whom Emily calls Red and Brown. The names given to them are a bit significant as Red is hot-tempered and more annoying and stressful than his companion. Brown is calmer and a little sympathetic towards Emily. The way the investigators pressed her for information, was nerve-wrecking for both the protagonist and the reader. \\n I didn\\'t feel that there was any character development. However, Emily\\'s swaying between what she felt was her responsibility towards Jack and what the police believed was realistic. I didn\\'t see Emily make a major realisation or revelation whether regarding herself or Jack. \\n I also felt the characters were crazy, all of them, not only Emily and Jack, the latter may have run away from a mental institution, but also Piggy, Jack\\'s and Emily\\'s families, as well as the whole town. I didn\\'t like any of the characters to be honest, and that put me off the book for a while. \\n Jack was eccentric in many ways, including eating raw food and sometimes food from the bin, like eating 25 bananas just walking home or eating in the bathroom. \\n I like the pun in the title, which I was sure was related to the heart of the novel from the beginning and even though at some point I felt that the author was leading me away from that pun. \\n I also like how the ending sort of diverged into two parts, even after we discover the mystery behind the killings, there is still the mystery of Jack and the man Emily calls Piggy, who added an interesting touch towards the end. \\n The novel has some good imagery and similes, and some descriptive and unconventional images such as: \\n \"Like a bag of unexploded possibilities.\" \\n \"Like we were now in the side act to the main play, dimly lit with an invisible audience tracking our every move.\" \\n The book is around 250 pages long but I felt it was at least twice or thrice as much. The chapters or sections are REALLY long and I felt like I was trudging my way to the end. \\n Apart from wanting to know who was behind the killings and making a promise to provide an honest review, I did not feel there was much to push me to keep going. In my opinion, I felt the novel needed more momentum. \\n For Kindle readers, The Sham should be read in white, mint or sepia, as there are several colours used that do not appear in the black-background view.',\n",
       " \"'Paulie' is a short story by M. A. Myers. I'm not sure when and where I got hold of a copy of this, but I've had it for a while and what better time to read a short horror story than in the spooky month of October! \\n 'Paulie' opens with Alice, a mother of three, who recently moved from the city to a farmhouse. She is preparing dinner and waiting for her husband to return. Soon after everything is set, a most awkward and terrifying announcement is made on television and everyone is advised to stay indoors. The news anchor says that some sort of disease or symptom is affecting people and turning them into killers. \\n The short story is about 14 or 15 pages long on PDF. It starts at a fairly slow pace but following the announcement, the pace picks up immensely. \\n Paulie is the name of one of the characters in the story, and what I like about this story is the constant sense of mystery in what is going to happen and what is happening. \\n Myers gives vivid description of every character and detail in his story, so there is nothing lacking in that area; the reader can easily picture everything. \\n I liked how Alice is portrayed as a very strong character. In spite of pain, both physical and emotional, she struggles to go on and save whatever is left of her family. \\n What I did not like about the short story was the very long paragraphs used and the occasional repetition of words used to describe the horrors Alice comes up against, but otherwise 'Paulie' is an enjoyable read. \\n I was also curious, why this disease as I call it does not affect her of all people. \\n Note: Glad I finally got to read it - if I had received it as a free copy for a review, my apologies for taking so much time.\",\n",
       " \"I've read sci-fi and I've read fantasy but sci-fi-fantasy that's new and I have to admit it's rather cool! \\n Doppelganger by Shawn Stern is certainly a bit of a new genre for me. It's a novella but with a novel's weight in all the details, research, characterisation and depth it entails. \\n The novel starts with a lab scene, an infant is being extracted from a failed experiment and a female scientist gives your life to save the child. The following chapters trace the life of this child growing up into Shane Fisher, a too-ordinary book store manager. \\n The novel shifts between Shane and another character called Cole, a martial artist and assassin, and whom the reader later finds out is a replica of Shane from the experiment mentioned earlier. \\n Naturally, when the two characters come in contact 'all hell breaks loose' as one of the chapters is adequately called. \\n The description throughout the novel is detailed and vivid. I loved the descriptions of Trent and Manny, one is described as a dwarf with a malicious smile and the other is described as it is an ape among other huge animals, and is nothing short of a T-rex: big, bloodthirsty and stupid. \\n Although Shane and Cole are very different, you can't help but like both, especially as there is a lot of Shane in all of us. \\n Fragile too is a likeable character with intense depth and importance to the novel. \\n Doppelganger ends at the climactic point and I can't wait for the second instalment, which I've been told will be out later this year.\",\n",

Consisting of 51 short chapters, it is easy to finish this detective novel in a day or two. \\n Set in 1985, the novel opens with a massive fire on \"the Mayacamas Mountains ridge above Santa Rosa, California\"; meanwhile a man on the other side of town hears heavy banging on his door in the middle of the night. The following morning, he wakes up to find a bloody-handprint on his door. This is where detective Angela Masters comes in to investigate. \\n Soon after, the detectives discover a severed hand near a neighbour\\'s window. Bit by bit they begin to assemble the pieces of this mystery and this victim. \\n Unlike the previous installments of series, Fire Storm contains many incidents of pursuit. It becomes difficult for the detectives when they know who they are pursuing but do not know what the perpetrators next move will be. \\n Fire Storm also has several intriguing twists as the reader realises that one of the killers knows Angela Masters, and detests her. An unlikely character identifies one of the perpetrators. \\n All this results in an epic final confrontation!',\n",

GHOST precedes ENTITLEMENT, and though I was familiar with the characters, I felt GHOST gave them more depth especially the lead detective/protagonist Angela. \\n GHOST opens with the rape and murder of Amanda Jensen. Despite their best efforts, detectives Angela Masters and Julie Phelps exhaust all their leads and the case stays open for almost a year, until finally a new lead appears. \\n In GHOST, we see a lot of character-background, which helps the reader form a better picture of each character. The pace of the novel is not as quick as ENTITLEMENT, since the case stays open for a while; nonetheless it is not a bad pace since it is divided into 46 short. \\n Since the novel is set in 1986, DNA-testing is highly expensive, not unheard of but has never been used in court. It's not as easy as seen in modern TV-series like CSI. GHOST shows how good Angela Masters is as a criminal profiler; however, she eventually realises that criminal-profiling still bears much guess work as compared to real detective work. \\n I must say GHOST, for me, was a quick read but was still slower than its successor ENTITLEMENT. \\n GHOST is an interesting crime novel with a strange but happy ending.\",\n",

Each of these stories is exceptional in its vividness, creativity and unfathomable twists! You have no idea what you\\'re up against! \\n Thirty Scary Tales boasts a ton of stunning imagery in this collection, whether scary or just plain beautiful. The reader cannot help but highlight and enjoy. The author also uses an array of settings for tales ranging from Germany to England to Turkey, and extending from Ancient Greece to the Middle Ages to modern times. \\n One of the Storm Dancer-set stories is The Colour of Dishonour with its layers of puns and irony (\"I have blood on my hands\"). I still cannot shake off the admiration (for Hall) and the horror (for the Captain). The Colour of Dishonour is a 10-star story. \\n By Your Own Free Will makes you think: How far would you go for love? How much are you willing to sacrifice to be noticed by one man? Would you trade your IQ for it? \\n Special thanks to Rayne Hall for creating and collecting this set of stories in a single volume and for sending me a free copy of Thirty Scary Tales for a Halloween review. I enjoyed reading them all. As for the Storm Dancer-set stories, this collection has prompted me to begin reading the dark epic novel as soon as I can. \\n For the full (extended) review: please click here (no spoilers): http://nadanessinmotion.blogspot.com/...',\n",

       " 'Cache a Predator by Michelle Weidenbenner is a mystery novel dealing with injustice, loss, fear, love and psychology. Her mixing of the psychological element with mystery and crime adds to the richness of her novel. \\n Cache a Predator opens with a shocking scene, where an unknown person mutilates a dead man by cutting off his penis. This first part is narrated in the first person; and throughout the novel we get to see certain acts and scenes through the eyes of the mutilator; the \"pecker-whacker\". \\n The novel also focuses on Brett Reed, a police officer in the town of Hursey Lake, who is divorced and whom the courts unjustly gave the custody of his five-year-old daughter, Quinn, to her alcoholic mother, Ali. We get to see glimpses of an alcoholic\\'s life, and how it affects them and all around them. We also meet counsellor Sarah Grinwald, whose troubled past has led her to taking up a job that allows her to take care of people. There is also the irony that despite her job, Sarah is not a good judge of character. \\n Cache a Predator has some beautiful imagery, which is seen in the opening lines of the novel. The description of a graveyard in particular has a dark but beautiful image. \"The way [The tombstones] were lined in rows, with husbands and wives side by side and children lying near their parents, made it look like a village, like shadows of square people hiding and watching without emotion. Like me.\" (p.6) \\n Having a soft spot for alliteration and oxymoron, I particularly liked the phrase \"sweet sickly scent\" on p. 12. \\n Cache a Predator opens with a gruesome but powerful first chapter. Chapter 2, on the other hand, starts in a totally different place with new people .We meet Quinn, her cop father and her jobless, alcoholic mother. We are also introduced to the \\'injustices\\' of the justice system and how it has favoured an alcoholic mother over a civil servant, a police officer, whose main fault is having a bad temper. \\n The novel takes the reader through the life of an alcoholic. Ali\\'s house is a dump with cigarettes and garbage littering the floor, and both her daughter and dog are unfed. Reflecting Brett Reed\\'s frustration with Ali\\'s behaviour, Weidenbenner uses another gruesome but highly creative image in \"He clenched his jaw, took a few eggs out of the fridge, and whisked them, beating them until they frothed over the sides of the bowl like the blood foaming in his veins.\" (p. 19) \\n The so-called \\'protective order\\' is highly ironic. Who is it supposed to \\'protect\\'? The drunk mother? Or the neglected child? And from whom?! \\n Throughout the novel, Brett claims that his father had abandoned him when he - Brett - needed his support. It is my opinion that this fear of abandonment further drives Brett\\'s protective instincts towards his daughter. The reader is also given a lot of evidence of the opposite or that he has changed. \\n Weidenbenner maintains good tension and relief in her novel. She uses light comic scenes or discussions to ease her readers\\' growing tension. An example is seen after the police, particularly Brett and his partner Clay, find Jake Hunter, the first mutilated victim. The whole scene though absurd and serious is funny. Jake tells the officers regarding his cut-off penis \"Easy for you to say. Yours is intact.\" Shortly after, Brett jokes, saying \"Makes me want to wear iron briefs under lock and key.\" (p. 34). \\n In chapter 5, the reader realises the reason the \"pecker-whacker\" does what he does. He does not choose his victims at random. And although one believes that it is a crime to mutilate another person, the reader cannot help but sympathise with this perpetrator, who is punishing sex offenders by cutting off their most prized organ; he is a criminal with a cause. \\n Sarah Grinwald is a counsellor, who works some children cases with Child Protective Services (CPS). Although she\\'s supposed to remain unbiased, we see her biased against Quinn\\'s cop father at first, but later changes that bias. Sarah, like many characters in this novel, has had a troubled past, which, at first, affects her judgement of Brett and we see her trying to fit him in her preconceived notions of bad fathers. However, she cannot help but notice the similarities between Quinn and her father and Ali\\'s evidently unhealthy and unsafe environment. \\n In chapter 8, we learn a bit about Ali\\'s past and upbringing. She\\'s not an alcoholic without reason. Sarah explains to Brett how Ali views the world and how her past has affected her. Weidenbenner\\'s use of psychology and past experiences is commendable as it gives reasons why each character is who they are and why they act the way they do. \\n It is ironic that justice system makes things more difficult for its civil servants when compared to regular citizens. The courts favour the mothers over the fathers, even if the former were unfit. \"Sarah knew the courts, and typically the mothers came out way ahead of the fathers. Unless they could prove Ali was unfit, Brett didn\\'t stand much of a chance.\" (p. 123) \\n Narration in Cache a Predator shifts between the first person perspective of the \"pecker-whacker\" and the third person perspective, which either describes events or acts as a means to reveal certain things through the characters\\' eyes. One scene is described once through Brett\\'s eyes and once through Sarah\\'s. \\n An important character, for me, in the novel is Brett\\'s partner, Clay. He is both the sense of reason and light humour in the novel. He is much calmer and more reasonable than his partner. He gives a sense of sanity to the story and acts as a reference for comparison with Brett. \\n The \"pecker-whacker\" obviously has bravery issues; it\\'s clear that they\\'ve been bullied before, and they admitted to being sexually abused. In addition, there are some instances that reveal this person\\'s slightly childish tendencies. They are also convinced that all fathers are bad; at a certain point they cannot tell right from wrong and cannot distinguish between their father and Brett. \\n We also meet the abominable character of Mrs. Greer, Ali\\'s mother. She appears twice in the novel and always succeeds to infuriate both Brett and the reader. When Ali crashes her car and kills a young woman, Mrs. Greer tells Brett \"Some guy came by to visit her. Said she killed his fiancee and he\\'s going to sue her for everything she has. Said Ali took away his entire future.\" She sniffled. \"I told him he needed to talk to you. That you were responsible, not Ali.\" \\n Quinn\\'s ordeal, being kidnapped, reunites the Reed family and brings the community together. \\n I enjoyed the police-work and crime language used in Cache a Predator. It feels like reading a bit of CSI. \\n Weidenbenner\\'s use of imagery never fails to surprise and inspire the reader. Another particularly beautifully-crafted image is on p. 171; \"Thoughts swirled in Brett\\'s head like dead leaves in a tornado\". Another image is seen in the closing lines of the novel; \"The grass showed its face, reminding Brett of life and how things thaw, grow, and change.\" - like people. \\n The dialogue in Cache a Predator is precise and nicely done conveying bits of relief when needed. The characters are realistic with no character being perfect. They all have the problems of their past which shape their present. The plot is held together well with a quick but good pace, and with good rise-and-fall in tension. There are, also, many interesting images throughout the novel. \\n **Note: I received a free copy from the author in exchange for an honest review.',\n",
       " \"An interesting and powerful book. It's not just the mystery and the suspense but the effort taken to delve into the hearts and minds of all the characters. \\n It is by all means a new and enjoyable book with twists and revelations. \\n It deserves a 4.5-star rating, blame Goodreads! \\n Lengthier review coming soon.\",\n",

But then, when Simon dies, the plot gets thicker and I found myself flipping pages. Out of the four, I loved Bronwyn and Nate the best. Cooper wasn't too bad, but Addy annoyed me the most. Her relationship with Jake was almost abusive - and in the end it kind of was, wasn't it? - and I was so happy when they broke up I may or may not have done a little dance of joy.

The book has a slow start - and I mean really slow, I literally reformatted some of my old blog posts for five hours before really getting into this book.

Of course, the mystery aspect doesn't get presented until near the end - although the prologue definitely hints at it - but in someways Unrivaled reminds me of Dangerous Girls.

However, when she opens the box she's in for the shock of her life because inside is a severed human leg. Strike thinks he knows who the killer is - or at least he has a few suspects - and tells the police, but they are only focused on one of the suspects who has connections to the mob. Strike and Robin - despite his best efforts to persuade her off the case - work together to figure out which suspect is responsible, which leads to some very interesting moments that deal with not only Stirke's past, but Robin's as well. \\n So, this book series seems to get better with every book. While The Cuckoo's Calling was very lagging in parts, The Silkworm had better moments between Robin and Strike and the same thing happened again in Career of Evil. You get to know Strike and Robin more while also dealing with an intense case. Unlike the previous two books, this time around you also get chapters that were done in the killer's POV and I have to admit that there were a few times I found myself pulling away from the book and checking to make sure that this was actually a Cormoran Strike novel.

Now, she has to live with the horrible truth along with the fact that Ms. Connely - her grandfather's chief of staff - shot the prime minister of Adria. But there was a reason for that. Not that anyone is telling her the whole truth. There is a society that is over a thousand years old, that is made up of all the founding women of Adria's ancestors. Grace's mother was part of it and Ms. Connely is part of it too and because of her mother, Grace is now being brought into the fold. \\n While that is going on, Grace's older brother Jamie comes back from West Point along with his friend Spence. Jamie has been worried about her, but she doesn't want to speak to him because for the last three years he has known the truth about what she has done. So to avoid him she goes to a party. However, she can't outrun her problems even at this party. Spence follows her and kisses her, but it isn't what she thought it would be and ends up running away. And runs right into Alexei who saw the whole thing. Which leads to a fight between the two boys. Thankfully it is broken up and both guys go their separate ways. Until Spence's body is found the next morning and Alexei is the prime suspect. \\n Okay, so I have a love hate relationship with this book. The first part of this book was slow and almost repetitive with Grace whining about the pain of killing her own mother and being not one hundred percent sure if what she sees is real or not. However, when Alexei shows up things get interesting and they get interesting fast.\",\n",

Sure, she may have seen her mother killed right in front of her eyes when she was thirteen, but doesn't mean that she's crazy. Especially when the coroner ruled her mother's death an accident. But that doesn't mean she's crazy. Just because she keeps seeing the man with the scar - aka the Scarred Man - everywhere she goes, doesn't mean she's crazy. And this time is no exception. \\n It's three years and a few hospitals and doctors later, and Grace has gone back to the United States embassy in Adria. Even here, her mother's memories haunt her, but that's not the scary part. The scary part is that she finally found him, and this time she's certain. Her friends Noah, Megan, and Rosie are going to try to help her bring him to justice, because her grandfather and his assistant don't believe her. But sometimes, Grace doesn't even believe in herself.\",\n",

She spends the rest of the party with her boyfriend trying not to think about him. The next day she's walking home alone right as night is falling when someone runs her over with a car. She wakes up in the hospital with a broken leg and multiple scratches on her face. And the added ability to see people's deaths when they touch her. \\n Considering Eva has this new ability she reacts rather calmly and just thinks its part of her recovery. While in the hospital, she's shocked to see Nate there and the two - whose friendship has been on the outs since middle school - reconnect. So much so that when she's sent home, her mother hires him to take care of her. But things are getting weird. Another girl in their class is found dead and the police believe the two cases are connected. But why did the killer leave Eva alive?\",\n",

The down on his luck private detective is no longer down on his luck. Because he solved the Lula Landry case his name has been in all the papers and a lot more people have come to see him about private detective work. He is now booked solid. But that doesn't stop him from taking on a case that he really shouldn't be taking on. A woman named Lenora comes to see him about the disappearance of her husband. He's an author, who has done this before and the last time he did she called the police. He wasn't too happy and that's why she decided this time around to bring in a PI. She believes that he's at a writer's retreat and leaves Strike with that information. \\n But he's not. In fact, he was never invited to that retreat. Circumstances get weirder as Strike tries to find the missing author. But when he finally does find him, he isn't alive. In fact, he's been disemboweled, body destroyed by acid and tied up. It's a gruesome scene, one that seems to be right out of the pages of his unpublished book that has caused quite a bit of ruckus. Where those he defamed are now suspects in his murder. Now Lenora has kept Strike on to find the murderer even though she is the prime suspect.\",\n",

There were a lot of times while reading The Cuckoo's Calling that I had to remind myself that this wasn't going to be the next Harry Potter although they were written by the same author. I don't usually read mysteries though and I kind of remembered why as I read this book. \\n The Cuckoo's Calling is about a private detective named Cormoran Strike - a war vet, the son of a famous celebrity, and a guy who's down on his luck - as he tries to solve the case of the potential murder of the famous model Lula Landry. The only problem is, this model died three months ago, but it wasn't a murder, it was a suicide, or so the police and coroner concluded in their investigation. But Lula's brother, John, doesn't think so. He thinks she was murdered, and comes to Strike for help. Strike doesn't want to take the case, because the police have already deemed it a suicide, but his private detective business is in financial trouble, and John is willing to pay more than double the usual fee. So against his better judgment he takes the case. \\n What follows is countless pages of interviews of Lula's old friends, coworkers, and family members. This girl was very troubled. Her rise to fame threw her into the spotlight too quickly, and she was paranoid about who she could trust.\",\n",

Eight months ago Korbie's brother broke up with Britt and she's been spending the whole year training for this very moment. She wants to prove to Calvin that she isn't the little girl that he left behind when he went to Stanford. But even a simple plan like this has its complications. \\n On her way to pick up Korbie, she stops for gas and some essentials - snacks and a Slurpee - when she runs into Calvin for the first time. He's there to convince her that she doesn't really want to spend the week at the family cabin to hike mountains. She isn't ready for that. But Britt knows he's just trying to get out of chaperoning the event and that he shouldn't worry that things are going to be awkward because she is so over him. She even points out that she's dating someone new. He doesn't believe her until she points out a newcomer to the store and says that's the guy she's dating.

Ablow also claims that Scott\\'s relationship with Amber was genuine, the one thing in Scott\\'s life he truly cared about, and he wouldn\\'t have gone on to kill if that relationship had lasted either. \\n Overall, this reads like a cheap arm chair psychology novel.

Ablow spends too much time sensationalizing his own opinions of Peterson by omitting certain facts.

Although some of the cases I was familiar with from the television series, just the way McCall Smith details them makes them more delightful. It is really a fun, amusing and cleverly written book. It deals with serious cases, and issues ranging from fraud to kidnapping but it doesn't drag you down. Precious, the No. 1 Ladies' Detective always behaves with confidence, class and dignity, even if she has a weakness for pumpkins and strange tree worms. You can see McCall Smith's love for Botswana and Africa reflected through the eyes of Precious. Thoroughly enjoyable!\",\n",
       " \"My first introduction to Jonathan Kellerman and the character Alex Delaware was Bad Love. I really liked Alex's character so I decided to start from scratch with the first novel. I really enjoyed Kellerman's portrayal of Alex. Although I found attempts to parallel the character with the legendary Philip Marlowe - their ages, wit, and Kellerman even references Marlowe. I liked the way Kellerman allowed Alex to unfold to the readers, and especially his chemistry with Milo. Alex is depicted as smart,funny, witty and sometimes a bit self-righteous, but you also admire his heroic attempts and obsession with solving the puzzle. With many suspense novels certain elements are predictable, based on Kellerman's descriptions you sense who he's grooming as the villains. Regardless, you still enjoy the ride, and this novel was great fun.\",\n",
       " \"** spoiler alert ** \\n My first introduction to Dennis Lehane's work was Shutter Island, which I found so amazing that I read it in one day. It has taken me awhile to get around to Mystic River. I deliberately avoided watching the movie as I didn't want anything to taint my experience of reading the book. Lehane is an excellent story teller, he takes you on these incredible rides in the minds of imperfect characters. Mystic River is centred around three characters Sean Devine, Jimmy Marcus and Dave Boyle. Interestingly from a crime novel perspective, they represent three sides of the story - the detective, the victim's family and the suspect. Only the victim's perspective was needed for a fuller detailing of the drama. I can't say I preferred any one of the characters. I can't say I loved any of the three, as they were all flawed as we are all in reality. However, despite their imperfections you root for them, empathize with them, crave to understand them, and even cry along with them. I knew who the killer was from Chapter 5. Jimmy Marcus, the father of the victim subtly intuited the possibility before knowing of his daughter's demise. Usually in mysteries the killer is never the one you suspect, but always hidden in plain view. I spent the rest of the book arguing with Devine for his slowness, Marcus for his coldness and hoping for a happier ending for Boyle. Waiting to see how Lehane would confirm my own suspicions. What little I know of Lehane's work is that they don't always have happy, just endings cheering for the hero. They often times leave you pondering with questions, and Mystic River certainly did that. Who was the real hero of the book? Was it Devine the Trooper, Marcus the Avenger, or Boyle the tortured victim of a crime 25 years in the past? Really a fascinating book, enjoyed it from start to finish.\",\n",

The sex and violence are graphic, but the way the story is handled was really well done. Typically, shifting back and forth between two time periods with what amount to diary entries can be tedious or confusing. Because the narrator of each time period has such a distinctive voice and personality, and because the entries are initially very close to the same dates (each entry is just before Christmas 2003 and 2007, etc.) I never had any issue tracking the where/when of the story. The way Haynes handles the OCD scenes is - well, exhausting, just as the OCD is for the character. I found a lot of empathy for a character that I did not at all relate to in the \"before\" sections through her later struggles. This was a terrifically paced debut - and one that began during NaNoWriMo, which is pretty cool in itself - in which nothing felt \"off\" as far as character or procedure.

I had picked it up at one point but life got in the way and I never got much past the beginning. My guilt over that compelled me to pick up her second novel a a couple of weeks ago. \\n In a nutshell, this is a thriller that tells multiple stories: one, a dead newborn found in the water and no clue as to her parentage; two, Molly, a woman struggling with a miscarriage and rebuilding her life with a new career; three, a teenage girl with a train wreck of a mother trying to survive her life; and four, the local sheriff, his brittle wife, their overachieving teenage daughter, and their falling-apart young son. Throw in a few side characters for atmosphere and shake. Life in a small town being what it is, the paths of all the players converge and separate and tangle up again as the novel moves toward an answer to the looming question: Whose baby is it, and how did she end up Where They Found Her? \\n Overall, I thought it was a good story, but I am not a fan of the writing style of this particular novel: \\n References are made to things that the reader is not yet privy to; once or twice, that\\'s intriguing, provocative. As often as it happens here, however, it\\'s frustrating. \\n Time shifts in odd ways; sometimes a conversation that seems to have just happened turns out to have happened weeks previous. \\n As Molly investigates the baby\\'s origins, she posts news items online as a companion to the pieces that appear in the printed paper. Her writing is... Well, every piece felt like something I would expect to see in a high school newspaper, not the town paper. The items definitely have a different \"voice\" than McCreight\\'s, but that voice doesn\\'t seem to fit Molly, either. The online blurbs seem to have been included solely so that the reader has access to the townsfolk\\'s comments that follow each piece. It felt gimmicky and unnecessary, even when a mini-mystery about those comments is also solved. \\n Overall, it\\'s not a bad story, but it felt a little simplistic while also feeling a little cluttered. A lot of characters are introduced at the outset that probably could have been handled with a bit more elegance. There were a few lightbulb moments that were fun as pieces clicked into place, but none of those pieces added up to the gut-punch I was hoping for.',\n",
       " \"I had a really hard time rating this book. I almost gave up on it in the beginning because the dialogue between the characters was so unnatural, and just for general writing style issues. One character was described in a way that made me think she was 19 or so, only to find out she was 27 - and she was constantly described as being innocent and a young woman when there were indicators she was neither. \\n The last half of the book was better because the plot got trickier and faster, and the last third was actually really good. My rating is for plot more than anything; I think in the hands of someone like Dennis Lehane this could have been amazing. There was nothing overtly wrong with the writing, it just didn't seem natural enough for a first-person voice, and there was one short chapter that wasn't in first person, which was jarring.\",\n",

       " 'Review originally posted on journeyintotheshelves.tumblr.com & journeyintotheshelves.wordpress.com. \\n **I received an eARC of this book courtesy of NetGalley and Random House. This has had no bearing on this review. \\n Ted loves puzzles, especially escape the room video game puzzles. When his great-uncle, who he was never really close to, passes and leaves Ted all of the items and \"treasures\" in his overstuffed apartment, Ted has no idea why. That is, until he realizes that his uncle\\'s apartment is set up just like an escape the room game. The deeper into the puzzle that Ted and his friends get, and the closer to the treasure they get, the danger that often accompanies his favorite video game also gets closer and incredibly real. Click Here to Start is filled with mystery, puzzles, and a bit of World War II history. It\\'s a quick, energetic middle grade read that is perfect for puzzle lovers, both young and old. \\n I was genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed this book. It was fast paced, engaging, and kept me glued to the pages. Personally, I am terrible at escape the room games, so I was really impressed at both the development and solutions to the puzzles in this book. The book never gives the answers right away, which leaves the reader a bit of time to try and think of the solution for themselves, which I thought was perfect. The novel has great build-up and an increase in suspense that doesn\\'t peter off until the last couple of pages (something that lacks in many mysteries, middle grade and otherwise). \\n The writing is easy to read - no unnecessary frills or anything of the sort - because it is geared toward a younger audience, but it worked for this novel. It kept everything much more grounded and connected to both Ted\\'s voice and the nature of the puzzles themselves. It read exactly like what a twelve year-old boy thinks (or at least, what I think one sounds like) and suited the tone and premise of the book nicely. \\n My absolute favorite aspect of this novel was the discoveries and discussions about Japanese Americans during World War II. Without overbearing the reader, Markell includes information about the dedicated Japanese American infantries, as well as the internment camps that were created \"to keep Americans safe\" during wartime after Pearl Harbor. With ease and simplicity, Markell is able to teach the reader a bit about a piece of important American history that is, sadly, not discussed and taught enough. Additionally, he is able to give enough information to satisfy a drive to want to search and learn more about this piece of history which is so important to instill in younger readers. \\n Overall, I greatly enjoyed Click Here to Start. It\\'s a quick, easy read filled with puzzles to keep you guessing, and bits of history to leave you searching for more.',\n",

       " 'Otro thriller psicologico de intriga y suspense, \"Domestic noir\" narrado en primera persona por alguien poco fiable debido a una amnesia etilica o un trauma psiquico. Sin detectives de por medio y con mujeres llevando las riendas de la investigacion y no, como tradicionalmente, en el papel de victimas. De entrada las estrategias para vender la novela son tan evidentes y descaradas que producen rechazo. Lo primero ese horroroso titulo a costa de meter la palabra \"Chica\" como sea para asi repetir el exito de ventas de las plagiadas \"La chica del tren\" y \"Perdida\" (Gone girl). Y luego ya en cuanto a la trama en si tomar elementos de las dos anteriores y \"mezclagitarlas\" con unas gotitas de \"Cincuenta sombras de Grey\" ?Que puede salir mal?.... \\n La historia esta narrada a dos voces en capitulos alternos: Jane (ahora) y Emma (antes). \\n Emma y su pareja Simon que vienen de un reciente atraco logran alquilar un piso que es el ultimo grito en cuanto a avances domoticos y minimalista en extremo que requiere de 200 reglas de obligado cumplimiento, entre otras la prohibicion expresa de no tener ninos, mascotas o incluso libros. \\n Dos anos despues Jane, que acaba de sufrir un aborto, alquila el mismo piso y al poco empieza a indagar sobra la historia de la antigua inquilina. La historia de ambas es tan parecida que muchas veces tienes que regresar al principio del capitulo para saber si estas con Emma o con Jane. Luego aparece en escena el tercer personaje principal: Edward Monkford el arquitecto que diseno el edificio y que recientemente perdio a su mujer y su hija en un accidente. \\n Se queda en tres estrellas porque el sexo es gratuito, un pelin de mal gusto ademas de poco creible y la historia del crimen esta metida con calzador. Sumado a todo eso: la poco originalidad del producto que fusila descaradamente a otras novelas de tematica parecida como ya comente anteriormente. \\n Si no quereis gastar ocho horas de vuestra vida en leer las cuatrocientas paginas (que por otro lado tiene el merito de que las paginas pasan a velocidad del rayo) podeis esperar a la pelicula y consumir solo dos.',\n",

       " 'Me ha entretenido como guia de Vitoria y me ha gustado mucho la ambientacion y el entorno; aparte de que se deja leer relativamente facil, pero como thriller psicologico / novela de asesinatos en serie deja mucho que desear. Mezcla tantos cliches de este tipo de novelas que en ocasiones parece una parodia al estilo de \"Agarrame como puedas\". Curiosamente cuanto mas tiempo pasa desde que lei la novela peor puntuacion me merece; lo pienso y me aparecen multitud de fallos. ?Alguien ha dicho \"Trilogia del Baztan\"? pues eso... \\n Comienza con plagio descarado de \"El silencio de los corderos\" (hasta en el titulo se parece) un preso ayudando a un policia a resolver un caso. El preso en cuestion tiene un hermano gemelo que precisamente fue el que lo encarcelo (por una muestra de ADN cuando en este tipo de gemelos el ADN es identico ??!!). Esta situacion que podria haber dado mucho juego, finalmente se queda en nada, mejor dicho en algo...contradictorio. \\n Los asesinatos se cometen a personas de determinada edad (5, 10, 15, 20 anos, o sea multiplos de cinco, menuda parida), con apellido compuesto, relacionandolos con monumentos historicos de la zona (de mas a menos antiguos). Para parecer mas excentrico aun porque a la autora le parece poco, los mata empleando abejas ?! \\n Por lo menos el libro no resulta aburrido en ningun momento aunque las situaciones que se dan son muy poco creibles y muy retorcidas, pero eso si que ganas de visitar Vitoria. Ademas son ahora las fiestas....',\n",
       " 'La primera obra del autor \"La ultima noche en Tremore Beach\" me parecio extraordinaria, un merecido cinco estrellas, la segunda me gusto un poco menos pongamos entre tres y cuatro y esta que nos ocupa se va a llevar dos. \\n Esperaba encontrar una novela al estilo de un Agatha Christie moderno pero la verdad es que la historia en si me ha resultado tan anodina como los personajes. La resolucion no sorprende en absoluto y ademas no cumple la norma de este tipo de novelas: el lector deberia poder descubrir al asesino con las pistas que hay en la propia narracion. cosaque aqui no se cumple. Lo peor de todo es lo poco que enganchan los acontecimientos, vas avanzando por inercia pero en cualquier punto podrias parar y te daria totalmente igual. \\n Esperemos que Mikel recupere la inspiracion de sus primeras obras en la siguiente porque tiene talento para ello de sobra.',\n",
       " 'Me he quedado a medias con las memorias de el lider de los \"Angeles del infierno\" en los anos 60. Lo mas entretenido son sus andanzas en la carcel, las normas del club y el relato de lo ocurrido en el festival de Altamont durante el concierto de los Rolling Stones. Lo demas es un poco repetitivo: hostias por aqui, navajazos por alla, companeros muertos en accidentes de moto, juicios por un tubo, drogas a mogollon... y lo cierto es que dicho asi suena interesante, quizas este contado de una manera muy monotona que no llega a engancharte del todo. A lo mejor me han traicionado las expectativas o es que se ha guardado las mejores anecdotas para los otros libros que ha publicado a posteriori y que no han llegado a Espana aun. Calificacion Notable bajo: 7/10',\n",
       " 'Me ha parecido una castana tremenda y no por violenta, pornografica o escandalosa sino por ser asaz aburrida. Mira que es corta la novela, pues no he podido con ella entera y he acabado leyendola en diagonal buscando esas escenas tan comentadas por lo violentas y explicitas que al final no he llegado a encontrar. Harto decepcionante.',\n",
       " 'Novela perteneciente al subgenero \"Domestic noir\" que comenzo con buenisimas novelas como \"No confies en nadie\", Perdida\" o \"Te deje ir\", otras no tan buenas como \"La chica del tren\" y algunas castanas como \"Observada\". \\n Esta que hoy nos ocupa yo la encuadraria en las regulares, se lee con interes pero no tiene giros narrativos brillantes ni personajes carismaticos (el que menos el policia que lleva la investigacion). La resolucion del caso tampoco esta mal pero lo que menos me ha gustado ha sido el narrador omnisciente que sabe lo que piensan y sienten todos los personajes y el recurso demasiado manido de la perdida de memoria de determinado personaje para poder desarrollar algunas tramas. \\n Si se tienen otras lecturas a mano, mejor esperar a ver la pelicula una tarde de domingo en Antena tres aunque el gancho de la premisa del relato, el secuestro de un bebe de seis meses, la peor pesadilla de cualquier madre, va a atraer a mucha idem.',\n",
       " 'Esta novela no se lee, en esta novela se vive. \\n Desde que me apunte a Goodreads nunca habia estado mas convencido de darle las cinco estrellas a un libro.

Y Carabanchel, sobre todo Carabanchel, omnipresente como epitome de todos los barrios de extrarradio de las grandes ciudades. \\n La estructura es original, envolvente y rompedora, como un caleidoscopio de historias: simultaneas, yuxtapuestas, todas ellas interesantes y singulares pero que giran alrededor de tres o cuatro personajes principales: Greta Santamaria y Marcelo Saravia, Susana Coelho y el arabe, y, sobre todo Max Luminaria, el carismatico asesino en serie de la moneda, un Jack el destripador contemporaneo del que conoceremos todos sus pensamientos, pulsiones, deseos y hasta el ultimo recoveco de su mente . Por el estilo me recuerda a Mazurca para dos muertos de Camilo Jose Cela. Es una novela muy negra y mas adictiva que el pegamento en bolsa. Esta plagada de actos criminales y sexo sucio y duro, o sea bien hecho como diria Woody Allen. \\n Hacedme caso, haced un alto en vuestra lista de lecturas y arrojaos de cabeza a \"Te quiero porque me das de comer\" me lo vais a agradecer. Si el autor hubiera sido americano ya seria conocido mundialmente y le habrian llovido los premios y las adaptaciones al cine o a la television de sus obras, pero claro es lo que tiene ser de Carabanchel que no tienes tanto eco. \\n TRANSGRESORA, ORIGINAL, IMPACTANTE, ADICTIVA: Un 11 sobre 10.',\n",

Mucha paja y poca sangre. Parece un chiste del tipo: \"Estas mas perdido que un noruego en Australia\". Al menos conocemos los origenes etilicos del protagonista y los sucesos que le llevaron a sus crisis actuales, lo que nos va a venir bien con las siguientes entregas. \\n Creo que voy a saltar directamente a \"El muneco de nieve\" cuya version cinematografica esta a punto de estrenarse y que ha recibido todas las alabanzas habidas y por haber.',\n",

A partir de ahi se nos cuentan los primeros pasos de Frankie en la \"cosa nostra\" alternando con los acontecimientos del presente hasta que ambos llegan a coincidir. No me extrana que Robert de Niro haya adquirido los derechos para adaptarlos a la gran pantalla porque la historia se ajusta a su perfil como un guante. \\n Como en otras entegas del autor (\"El poder del perro\" o \"El cartel\") hay una parte del libro (10/15%) muy confusa con personajes y situaciones intrascendentes que empana el resultado final; hasta que por fin se recupera la linea principal que hay que decir que esta muy bien definida. Si te gustaron \"Los Soprano\" o \"Boardwalk Empire\" este es tu libro. Tambien recomendado para el publico generalista',\n",
       " 'Mi zona lectora de confort es la novela de crimenes y mas aun la modalidad whodunit (contraccion de la pregunta inglesa \"Who has done it?\" \"?Quien lo ha hecho?\") que practica Agatha Christie entre otros. En esta modalidad el lector cuenta con las mismas pistas que el detective literario para encontrar al asesino y no es hasta el final del relato cuando se descubre al mismo. Y si encima aparece Hercules Poirot el bienestar lector ya es insuperable. \\n Con eso y con todo el caso que nos ocupa es un tanto particular ya que la investigacion es de un caso acaecido dieciseis anos atras, perfecto para Poirot que se vanagloria de ignorar las pistas, huellas etcetera (y que segun el se pueden falsear, cosa que no sucede con las motivaciones) y descubrir al culpable solamente pensando, usando sus \"little gray cells\" pequenas celulas grises. \\n Lo malo es que resulta un poco reiterativo: primero los testimonios de los cinco implicados y despues su version escrita de los hechos, sumado a que Poirot sale poco y la solucion final no es demasiado sorprendente. Todo eso hace que se quede en tres o tres y media estrellas de valoracion.',\n",
       " 'Un caso criminal visto desde varios puntos de vista: la policia, la prensa, el mismo imputado etc. Esta estructurado en tres partes, ocupando la primera mas de la mitad del libro, en la que se narran los hechos; en la segunda se viaja al pasado y en la tercera asistimos a la celebracion del juicio. Se deja leer con relativa facilidad aunque en algunos tramos resulta un poco repetitivo. El final resulta bastante predecible y queda abierto a una segunda parte lo que resulta realmente insatisfactorio. En lineas generales lo recomiendo. \\n Me ha recordado vagamente a Perdida o al caso de Breton',\n",
       " 'Prohibido leer la sinopsis porque revela mas informacion de la deseada. Asesinatos, descuartizamientos, mafias y de fondo retratos de familias disfuncionales y trabajos nocturnos alienantes. Alguna subtrama me sobra, hay pocos giros narrativos (uno de ellos muy bueno pasada mas de la mitad de la novela, aunque poco aprovechado) y el final no esta muy conseguido que se diga, por lo menos para nuestra mentalidad occidental pero compensan los fluidos dialogos y lo facil que se lee en general. Tiene animo del tipico best seller orientado para todo tipo de publico y ese aspecto lo cumple con creces. Puede que pruebe con alguna otra obra de la misma autora.

Se nos muestra el conflicto del contrabando de drogas en Mexico y como intervienen en el el gobierno la policia, el ejercito, los medios de comunicacion, la poblacion civil etc. En este punto la historia se vuelve mas dramatica ya que asistimos a la guerra entre los distintos carteles que manejan el negocio entre los que destacan los Zeta, grupo formado en el ejercito para combatir el crimen y que acabo pasando al otro lado del conflicto apoyando al cartel del Golfo. Quizas este un punto por debajo de su anterior entrega pero no va a defraudar a la gente que compra un libro con ese titulo y esa portada que logicamente espera encontrar una radiografia exhaustiva del fenomeno del narcotrafico y extorsion mexicano. \\n Dentro de poco tendremos pelicula realizada por Ridley Scott',\n",

Solo tenias que mencionar su craneo calvo con forma de huevo, describir como brillaban sus ojos verdes cuando entraban en accion sus pequenas celulas grises, soltar de vez en cuando una expresion en frances, destacar su obsesion compulsiva por el orden extremo, colocar a su lado a un companero medianamente inteligente que le ayudara en la investigacion y que a imagen y semejanza del lector anduviera perdido durante la mayor parte del libro. Luego solo te quedaba reunir a los principales sospechosos en una sala y hacer que Poirot se luciera con una explicacion sencilla, creible, nunca enrevesada, y dando detalles que todos los demas han dejado escapar por considerarlos banales pero que eran la clave para resolver el caso. \\n Y si hubieras hecho todo eso con un minimo de gracia hubieras triunfado, pero desgraciadamente has hecho todo lo contrario y la gente de a pie se pregunta como demonios has obtenido el visto bueno de los herederos de Agatha Christie para producir este pastiche en el mal sentido de la palabra.

Hay muchos personajes y poco definidos, ademas la quimica entre los principales Marcus el \"penitenciario\" y Sandra una fotografa de la policia es practicamente nula. Los crimenes son un plagio descarado (ya que el autor no los menciona como reales en la entrevista que aparece al final del volumen) de los cometidos por el llamado \"Monstruo de Florencia\" que ya tiene una version literaria de Douglas Preston y Mario Spezi.

La historia es predecible hasta la nausea, no hay giros narrativos ni sorpresas a lo largo de la trama. Lo de encuadrar la historia en una trilogia esta traidisimo por los pelos no se sostiene por ningun lado asi que os la podeis saltar perfectamente.

Si le quitaramos dos tercios seria mucho mas disfrutable, de esta manera se queda en poco menos que olvidable.',\n",
       " '10/10 Este es el libro del ano sin duda. Un thriller dramatico con trazas de novela historica, una \"novela total\". Un repaso minucioso tambien de los crimenes del estalinismo, la segunda guerra mundial y la guerra civil sin dejar de lado la epoca contemporanea. Una historia, en la que no sobra ni una pagina, que te mantendra en vilo desde el primer capitulo, que contiene un final redondo y por el medio algunos giros sorprendentes que tardaras mucho tiempo en olvidar. Todo lo bueno que se diga es poco. Recomendable 100%',\n",
       " '6,5/10 Crimen. Mira que me caen bien los autores pero mi opinion sincera (en contra de la mayoria de la critica) es que estamos ante el peor de sus tres libros. He encontrado personajes y tramas de relleno, malos carentes de carisma y a pesar de lo que presumen los autores situaciones muy poco creibles y bastante topicas. Por otro lado se mantienen las virtudes de los dos anteriores, se lee con rapidez y con cierto interes y nunca con confusion a pesar de llevar adelante varias tramas a la vez. El ritmo es televisivo mas que cinematografico con microcapitulos de apenas un par de paginas en algunos casos que no acaban de encajar bien en el conjunto del relato. Esperemos y seguro que sera asi, que en siguientes entregas retomen las maneras de sus primeras obras, sobre todo la primera, la cuasi perfecta \"Crimenes exquisitos\"',\n",
       " '5/10 Lamento disentir de la opinion general sobre esta novela que la encumbra como una de las mejores muestras del genero negro del siglo pasado. Me ha resultado bastante insipida y carente de interes,. Tampoco me han gustado las casi inexistentes referencias a Alicia en el pais de las maravillas. A lo mejor en una relectura le cojo el punto. A mi modo de ver ha envejecido bastante mal.',\n",
       " '9/10 Estupenda novela que la critica ha ensalzado como de las mejores del ano y en este caso ha acertado de pleno. La trama esta excelentemente desarrollada y contada a traves de los pensamientos de un escritor que se retira a una casa perdida de Irlanda y al que comienzan a sucederle una serie de hechos que lindan con lo sobrenatural pero que al final acaban manteniendo un perfecto equilibrio con la racionalidad mas absoluta. La trama te atrapa sin remedio y no te deja soltar el libro a menos que no tengas mas remedio; a mi me duro tres dias. Impactante, terrorifico en ocasiones y deliciosamente escrito. Seguro que lo adaptaran al cine o a la television pero ya os digo yo que es imposible que superen al relato. SOBRESALIENTE',\n",

The mention of a millionaire being stabbed, a shallow grave, and a love letter suggests a complex plot with themes of crime and detection, which is characteristic of the 'mystery, thriller, crime' genre. The fact that it is part of the Hercule Poirot series, a well-known series of detective novels by Agatha Christie, further supports this classification. Since the book is a work of fiction with a made-up story and characters, it also fits into the broader 'fiction' category. The historical setting and potential historical context could justify a low confidence in 'history, historical fiction, biography', but there's not enough information to suggest it's a primary genre. Similarly, while romance might be a subplot, it doesn't seem to be the main focus, hence the low confidence. Lastly, there's no clear indication that the book is targeted at a young-adult audience specifically, making 'young-adult' a less likely genre.\"\n",
