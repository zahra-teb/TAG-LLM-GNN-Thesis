The concept was created after a trip to France in 2001. There we came across some new French artists who fused electronica with funk and jazz. The resulting album, Paris Under a Groove received some critical buzz. So, we decided next to begin a San Francisco project, and in the process found some great talent. The SF sound has a more mellow side compared with New York and Chicago. In capturing that vibe, the album, focuses in on a funk/jazz electronica sound, deep basslines and sultry vocals. Perfect for kicking off any cocktail hour. The album's back side includes soulful breakbeat and deep house tracks played in Soma clubs. Featuring tracks from Miguel Migs and Movido featuring Lisa Shaw, Loveslap's deep house remix of Goapele's hit track Closer, and introducing, Andre Castano, Superbacana, Irina Mikhailova & Mr Untel, Karmacoda, Triangle Orchestra, Will Felt, and Tetris.

1279705,Walt Disney Treasures - Behind the Scenes at the Walt Disney Studio,"As Walt Disney's fame grew during the 1930s, people wanted to know more about his studio and how the ""Silly Symphonies"" and Mickey Mouse shorts were created. Although Disney seldom allowed visitors, he periodically offered viewers peeks inside into the studio through the films in this collection. In 1937, Disney madeA Trip Through the Walt Disney Studiosfor his distributor, RKO, to help the marketing campaign forSnow White. This in-house documentary was later reworked and released as a trailer for the studio's first feature asHow Walt Disney Cartoons Are Made. In 1941, humorist Robert Benchley toured the studio and chatted with the artists inThe Reluctant Dragon. But the film was released during a bitterly fought strike that belied its cheerful depiction of the studio.During the '50s, Walt used his studio as a backdrop for several episodes of theDisneylandTV series. ""The Story of the Animated Drawing"" traces the history of the medium, including re-creations of Emil Reynaud's Th&#xE9;&#xE2;tre Optique (1892-1900) and Winsor McCay's vaudeville routine with his landmark filmGertie the Dinosaur(1914). ""Tricks of Our Trade,"" which focuses on the creation ofSleeping Beauty, shows staged footage of four of the celebrated ""Nine Old Men""--Marc Davis, Milt Kahl, Frank Thomas, and Ollie Johnston--sketching. In the DVD bonus material, host Leonard Maltin traces the development of the studio facilities from a Los Angeles garage to its present location in Burbank. Maltin also chats with Disney legend Joe Grant, who cowrote the ""Baby Weems"" sequence inReluctant Dragon. Recorded at the time of Grant's 94th birthday, the artist displays the sly wit that continues to inspire animators. (Unrated: Suitable for all ages: cartoon violence)--Charles Solomon"

1581594,A Letter to Mrs. Roosevelt,"First-time author De Young uses her own family history to create a Depression-era story about first-generation Italian-Americans living in Johnstown, Pa., in 1933. Eleven-year-old Margo Bandini, her parents and young brother, Charlie, face losing their house if they do not find a way to pay back the bank loan used to cover hospital expenses for Charlie's emergency leg operation. In a letter, Margo appeals to Eleanor ""Everywhere"" Roosevelt, the person she admires most, for help. Her teacher (who moonlights as a reporter and knows the First Lady) provides a swift, personal delivery of the letter and soon Margo receives a reply that restores her faith in miracles and resolves the crisis. Despite its rather contrived conclusion, this historic novel is successful in conveying the climate of the times: the ""domino"" effect of the steel mill cutting back workers' hours translating into failing businesses and the necessity of neighbors relying on one another for support during hard times. Margo emerges as an admirable heroine whose actions reveal a generous heart and determination to help her family hold on to their home.

31003,Dreaming in Cuban,"Garcia's first novel is about Cuba, her native country, and three generations of del Pino women who are seeking spiritual homes for their passionate, often troubled souls. Celia del Pino and her descendants also share clairvoyant and visionary powers that somehow remain undiminished, despite the Cuban revolution and its profound effect upon their lives. This dichotomy suffuses their lives with a potent mixture of superstition, politics, and surrealistic charm that gives the novel an otherworldly atmosphere. Garcia juggles these opposing life forces like a skilled magician accustomed to tossing into the air fiery objects that would explode if they came into contact. Writing experimentally in a variety of forms, she combines narratives, love letters, and monologs to portray the del Pinos as they move back and forth through time. Garcia tells their story with an economy of words and a rich, tropical imagery, setting a brisk but comfortable pace. Highly recommended.- Janet W.

Then there are the notable covers of his own songs by Three Dog Night (&#34;One&#34;), the Monkees (&#34;Cuddly Toy&#34;), the Yardbirds (&#34;Ten Little Indians&#34;), and Blood, Sweat & Tears (&#34;Without Her&#34;). Others will recall the duo of hits that appeared alongside &#34;Without You&#34; on 1971's Nilsson Schmilsson album, &#34;Coconut&#34; (#8) and &#34;Jump Into The Fire.&#34; Finally, the playful &#34;Me And My Arrow&#34; (from the soundtrack of his animated film The Point!) and &#34;Girlfriend&#34; (theme of the early '70s sitcom The Courtship Of Eddie's Father) have their own coterie of admirers.THE RCA ALBUMS COLLECTION presents the definitive 14 albums in Nilsson's RCA Records U.S. discography, from his 1967 debut Pandemonium Shadow Show (among whose high points are his takes on the Beatles' &#34;You Can't Do That&#34; and &#34;She's Leaving Home&#34;) to his final album for the label in 1977, Knnillssonn.

425088,Once a Dreamer,"Can a realist and a romantic fall in love? This is the central question in Hern's (The Bride Sale; etc.) atypical and often frustrating early 19th-century romance. Cynical widow Eleanor Tennant doesn't believe in love, so when her niece, Belinda, falls for a reformed rake, Eleanor urges her to choose someone with more wealth and status. Instead, Belinda follows the advice of the Busybody, a columnist for the Ladies' Fashionable Cabinet, and remains steadfast in her devotion. Enraged, Eleanor tracks down the Busybody, only to find that the ""sentimental old biddy"" is Simon Westover, a bookish romantic who will do anything to keep his identity concealed. In return for Eleanor's silence, Simon agrees to set things right by her niece, but their arrangement becomes far more complicated when they learn that Belinda has run away to elope. Determined to rescue Belinda, Eleanor blackmails Simon into helping her track down the couple. A strong physical attraction develops between Eleanor and Simon, despite her venomous attitude and appalling behavior (she smacks him twice and betrays his trust). By the end, readers will root for the adorable beta male to leave rather than love Eleanor. Though Hern has a firm understanding of the period, her narrow-minded heroine is unlikely to earn the reader's favor or empathy.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc."

2357926,Quantum Field Theory,"""This accessible and conceptually structured introduction to quantum field theory will be of value not only to beginning students but also to practicing physicists interested in learning or reviewing specific topics. The book is organized in a modular fashion, which makes it easy to extract the basic information relevant to the reader's area(s) of interest. The material is presented in an intuitively clear and informal style. Foundational topics such as path integrals and Lorentz representations are included early in the exposition, as appropriate for a modern course; later material includes a detailed description of the Standard Model and other advanced topics such as instantons, supersymetry, and unification, which are essential knowledge for working particle physicists, but which are not treated in most other field theory texts.""Washington Taylor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology""Over the years I have used parts of Srednicki's book to teach field theory to physics graduate students not specializing in particle physics. This is a vast subject, with many outstanding textbooks. Among these, Srednicki's stands out for its pedagogy. The subject is built logically, rather than historically. The exposition walks the line between getting the idea across and not shying away from a serious calculation. Path integrals enter early, and renormalization theory is pursued from the very start...By the end of the course the student should understand both beta functions and the Standard Model, and be able to carry through a calculation when a perturbative calculation is called for.""Predrag Cvitanovic, Georgia Institute of Technology""This book should become a favorite of quantum field theory students and instructors. The approach is systematic and comprehensive, but the friendly and encouraging voice of the author comes through loud and clear to make the subject feel accessible. Many interesting examples are worked out in pedagogical detail.""Ann Nelson, University of Washington""I expect that this will be the textbook of choice for many quantum field theory courses. The presentation is straightforward and readable, with the author's easy-going 'voice' coming through in his writing. The organization into a large number of short chapters, with the prerequisites for each chapter clearly marked, makes the book flexible and easy to teach from or to read independently. A large and varied collection of special topics is available, depending on the interests of the instructor and the student.""Joseph Polchinski, University of California, Santa Barbara""This is an extraordinary book, a real gem. After a cursory glance, all will have the clear impression that this is a ""revolutionary"" book. In my opinion, this is simply the best QFT textbook ever written... it is absolutely invaluable.""Giuseppe Nardelli, Mathematical Reviews"

And what a bomb to drop for a debut! It was heavier, and more militant, than anything that had ever been heard in reggae before, taking elements of the music and combining them in a new way. A concept album of sorts, it helped raise awareness of the black leader while still keeping a strong Rasta vibe to the sound, hypnotic and dread. Time has shown it to be one of the classic albums of reggae, charged and powerful.Chris Nickson"
1432541,Blackheart Man,"Pure spine-tingling, heart-swelling inspiration from foundation Wailer Bunny Wailer (Neville Livingston)--with his ex-Wailer mates Bob Marley and Peter Tosh lending backup support on some tracks. This is one of the greatest reggae albums ever, a 1976 solo debut that virtually defines roots reggae as the musical vehicle for the ""reasonings"" of the amalgam of Garvey's pan-Africanism and Old Testament thunder that is Rastafari. Virtually every track elucidates Rasta ""livity"" and offers an intensely visceral portrait of the struggles endured by the international ""sufferah dem."" And it's all leavened by the Rastafarian vision of a just future world united by One Love. Reggae--hell, pop music!--doesn't get better than these 10 tracks--especially ""Dreamland,"" ""Fighting Against Conviction,"" ""Fig Tree,"" and the title tune.--Elena Oumano"

1492092,96 Degrees in the Shade,"Fusing reggae, rock and funk into one compelling musical package, Third World is more than just one of the top all-time reggae groups, it has become something of a tradition. The band clearly holds dear its cultural and ancestral roots, but they still push the envelope for reggae music worldwide. Not only are Third World one of the most influential reggae bands of all time, they are also among the longest-lived: over three decades, which is a pretty great run for any band, but they are still performing and extending their streak. In 1973, teenager Stephen ""Cat"" Coore - at the time a member of the band Inner Circle - left that group, and with a fellow musician from another band, Colin Leslie, conceived and launched Third World. Their 1974 Kingston live premiere earned them great reviews and gigs, as they were the only group at the time made up of young, talented, trained musicians playing such a mesmerizing combination of reggae and funk. Not long thereafter, the band opened to great reviews for The Jackson 5, and then went off to tour in England, where they were noticed by musical visionary Chris Blackwell, founder of Island Records. Blackwell offered them a record deal and a slot on a European tour opening for Bob Marley and The Wailers. They released an eponymous debut album in 1976, followed closely the next year by the legendary album 96 In The Shade. The latter disc heralded the arrival of a new drummer, Willie Stewart, and a new lead singer (who had also been a member of Inner Circle), William ""Bunny Rugs"" Clark. The combination clicked, not only in Jamaica and the UK, where the band already had a significant and growing fan base, but in America also. This version of 96 In The Shade features a previously-unreleased alternate extended mix of ""Rhythm Of Life"" and alternate mixes of ""Feel A Little Better"" and the band's breakout smash, ""1865 (96 In The Shade)."" Make no mistake: 96 In The Shade is just plain hot."

1530042,"""Trading with the Enemy: A Yankee Travels Through Castro's Cuba""","According to a joke making the rounds among Cubans during the author's six-month stay in 1990, the three great triumphs of the Cuban revolution are education, health and athletics; the three great failures are breakfast, lunch and dinner. But while the shortages were inescapable, Miller ( The Panama Hat Trail ) was impressed by the highly literate, lively people he met, the good libraries, the health care, the beauty of the landscape and the widespread devotion of the people to Castro, despite Cuba's increasing hardships. Miller's closest relations were with sophisticated intellectuals, but he joined the masses to stand on lines for diminishing goods, to ride the local buses, to tour the country and to listen to the gossip, complaints and jokes as well as the loyal defenses. (He loved the ice cream too.) In late 1991, Miller returned briefly to find his friends girding for the even greater sacrifices imposed by the loss of Russian aid and the continuing U.S. boycott. Although Cuba remains off-limits for most Americans due to the Trading with The Enemy Act referred to in the title, this even-handed and affectionate account of the country and its people makes an entertaining armchair substitute for a visit.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."
940638,Malinche: A Novel,"Through the eyes of the historical native woman of the novel's title, Esquivel (Like Water for Chocolate) reveals the defeat and destruction of Montezuma's 16th-centuryMexicasempire at the hands of Spanish conquistador Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s. Malinche, also called Malinalli, was sold into slavery as a child and later became ""The Tongue,"" Cort&eacute;s's interpreter and lover&mdash;remembered by history as a traitor for her contribution to the brutal Spanish triumph. In her lyrical but flawed fifth novel, Esquivel details richly imagined complications for a woman trapped between the ancientMexicascivilization and the Spaniards. Esquivel revels in descriptions of the role of ancient gods in native life and Malinalli's theological musings on the similarities between her belief system and Christianity. But what the book offers in anthropological specificity, it lacks in narrative immediacy, even while Esquivel also imagines Cort&eacute;s's point of view. The author also packs the arc of Malinalli's life into a relatively short novel: she bears Cort&eacute;s an illegitimate son, marries another Spaniard and has a daughter before her sad demise. The resulting disjointed storytelling gives short shrift to this complex heroine, a woman whose role in Mexican history is controversial to this day.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

732110,Have You Seen Her?,"Offering heart-racing thrills, both in the bedroom and the forensics lab, this second romantic intrigue from Rose (Don't Tell) showcases her growing talent. Rose has created complex, realistic characters in high school teacher Jenna Marshall and Special Agent Steven Thatcher, whose eldest son, Brad, is in Jenna's class. Though Steven, a widower, is in the midst of a search for a serial killer who targets cheerleaders in their small North Carolina town, he takes time to visit Jenna when she calls to tell him that Brad, who used to be a high achiever, is flunking out of chemistry. When they meet, their own chemistry takes over and they find themselves falling in love, despite their troubled romantic pasts and the fact that Jenna may be next on the killer's list. Rose populates her novel with vivid characters - like Steven's seven-year-old son Nicky, who was a character in Rose's previous novel - and stokes the tension to a fever pitch, throwing in shocking twists each time the story threatens to settle into predictability. Though some of Steven and Jenna's lovers' quarrels deteriorate into melodrama, readers will hardly notice as they rush to the novel's thrilling conclusion.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

2255943,"Egyptian Gods and Goddesses (Penguin Young Readers, L4)","Grade 1-3-This beginning reader opens with a brief lineup of gods and goddesses including Horus, Re, Thoth, Montu, Osiris, Isis, and Anubis and then goes into an account of the Egyptians' fascination with death and the afterlife. Readers find out why pyramids and mummies were so important, and how bodies were prepared for their trip to the Underworld. The book closes with a quick look at modern Egyptians and their beliefs. The watercolor illustrations have decorative borders, hieroglyphs, and line drawings of people and gods. Much of the book is devoted to the exploration of death customs and belief systems; the gods and goddesses play a minor part, rendering the title slightly misleading.

15045,Our Family Tree: An Evolution Story,"Kindergarten-Grade 3-Evolution is a ticklish topic. It is controversial to some for religious reasons; for others, it is a challenging concept to present to a young audience without losing scientific veracity. For one thing, young children have little concept of time-a million years might be the span between birthdays. For another, the idea of slow, evolutionary change still seems somehow equal to a magician's trick. So, accomplishing a reasonable explanation of a scientific concept and its progress through millennia is worthy of note. Peters's simple text uses the ""we/us"" format to place Homo sapiens in the ""family"" of life at its very beginnings. ""All of us,"" she states in the first sentence of the book, ""are part of an old, old family,"" going back to Earth's beginnings. ""We've changed a lot since then."" Through a simple progression, amply bolstered by Stringer's striking, large acrylics, she traces ""our"" family tree from unicellular organisms through amphibians, therapsids, and early mammals to early primates, hominids, and our distinct ""humanness"" today. Enriched by two pages of additional data and a colorful time line, the whole is rounded out by carefully written author and illustrator notes. Simpler than Stephen Webster's The Kingfisher Book of Evolution (2000) and Melvin Berger's How Life Began (Doubleday, 1990; o.p.), and perhaps easier than Joanna Cole's venerable Evolution (Crowell, 1987; o.p.), this book is a wonderful companion to Steve Jenkins's equally attractive Life on Earth (Houghton, 2002).Patricia Manning, formerly at Eastchester Public Library, NYCopyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc."

1695687,This Is Hope: Green Vegans and the New Human Ecology,"In THIS IS HOPE Will Anderson proposes a unifying and comprehensive approach to stop the loss of ecosystems and biodiversity and to end the wanton abuse of wild and domesticated nonhuman animals (animals). ... a wide range of people will find common ground....&quot;A unifying and comprehensive approach.&quot; Marc Bekoff, Ph.D., University of Colorado; author of many books includingThe emotional lives of animals, Animals matter, Wild justice: The moral lives of animals, and The animal manifesto: Six reasons for expanding our compassion footprint.""We have the power."" We are at the precipice where human existence and that of all other species is in doubt. Can we commit to a course of action in time to stop the loss of biodiversity, while increasing human prosperity? In This Is Hope, we realize that our old way of thinking about our place in the world must change. Here you will find not just another explanation of where we have gone wrong; but also that we have the power to create the world all of us would hope for ourselves and future generations. ~Brenda Peterson, author of Build Me an Ark: A Life with Animals and Animal Heart""Thoughtful and thought-provoking."" This is Hope is thoughtful and thought-provoking. In this comprehensive and well-researched book, Will Anderson weaves together the impact our behaviors have on the web of life, without leaving loose ends. As a vegan, somebody with a comparatively light footprint on the planet, I appreciated the reminder that when I buy non organic vegan products I poison the Earth and thereby the animals. That may be what Anderson does best -- he challenges us to do better. ~Karen Dawn, author of Thanking the Monkey: Rethinking the Way We Treat Animals.""Never forget."" Hope is filled with well-documented insights, eloquently expressed, into the causes and conditions of the malaise spreading over the Earth... This book presents its solid conceptual arguments in lucid prose while evoking the experiences of actual beings who, once you have lived with them in its pages, you will never again be able to forget.... ~Karen Davis, PhD, is the President and Founder of United Poultry Concerns and the author of Prisoned Chickens, Poisoned Eggs,More Than a Meal, The Turkey in History, Myth, Ritual, and Reality, and The Holocaust and the Henmaid's Tale.""The book explores the ecological and moral arguments for a new way of living that is strongly compelling. It is thoroughly researched and presented in an accessible format which would make fascinating reading for anyone who wants to make a difference."" Rev. Elaine Walker | Interfaith Minister and TutorFinally! A MUST READ for anyone seeking a practical planetary path from the current trajectory of death and desperation to one that truly engages and embraces hope for all species. This book provides a pioneering path for those who truly want to be the change we want&mdash;and need&mdash;to see in this world. As we collectively experience this never-before era of one species empowered to make it or break it for all, we now have HOPE to survive together. As a scientist in wildlife management and conservation, I can attest to tragically ridiculous and archaic methods that continue to be used (mis)manage wildlife and plant species for human ignorance and greed rather than for the planet and successive generations.This Is Hopeincorporates the best and the brightest of science while allowing for the potential of humanity - in an emerging planet of interspecies coexistence and survival.(Toni Frohoff)"

884962,Overtreated: Why Too Much Medicine Is Making Us Sicker and Poorer,"Starred Review.Contrary to Americans' common belief that in health care more is more&mdash;that more spending, drugs and technology means better care&mdash;this lucid report posits that less is actually better. Medical journalist Brownlee acknowledges that state-of-the-art medicine can improve care and save lives. But technology and drugs are misused and overused, she argues, citing a 2003 study of one million Medicare recipients, published in theAnnals of Internal Medicine, which showed that patients in hospitals that spent the most were 2% to 6% more likely to die than patients in hospitals that spent the least. Additionally, she says, billions per year are spent on unnecessary tests and drugs and on specialists who are rewarded more for some procedures than for more appropriate ones. The solution, Brownlee writes, already exists: the Veterans Health Administration outperforms the rest of the American health care system on multiple measures of quality. The main obstacle to replicating this model nationwide, according to the author, is a powerful cartel of organizations, from hospitals to drug companies, that stand to lose in such a system. Many of Brownlee's points have been much covered, but her incisiveness and proposed solution can add to the health care debate heated up by the release of Michael Moore'sSicko.(Sept.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It is 100% safe (except if allergic) to take regularly, but only use as needed. Lugol's iodine is old-fashioned iodine and years ago was used for treating various illnesses. It has a distinctive trait - it hangs up on everything. In the stomach, it attaches to vicious salmonella, bacteria, parasite eggs and they are doomed. The thyroid is the organ most capable of absorbing iodine. Pathogenic microorganisms, the primary cause of disease, are made weaker and most are killed as they pass through the thyroid, provided, it has its normal supply of iodine. Clinical studies show that very few people have enough iodine in their thyroid to function optimally. This deficiency has occurred in the 20th century because of chlorine in drinking water, the alteration of natural food sources and modern farming practices. Aggravating the problem is that the body does not conserve iodine, therefore, we must get a regular supplemental intake to maintain optimal health. The Thyroid, Iodine and Disease Prevention The role of the thyroid gland has been understood for some time now. Although conventional medicine places emphasis on its contribution to regulating the body's metabolism, and equally important role is its contribution to the immunological health and body. You would get 3.125 mg of iodine out of a vertical drop and 6.25 mg out of a horizontal drop. In a 2 oz. bottle you would get roughly 250 drops. The solution will go right to the bloodstream by passing the digestion process also liquid is more controlled and you can get more uses out of it. You can apply it to the skin or take it orally"

952943,Sinsemilla,"Until internal conflicts tore Uhuru apart, group founder Duckie Simpson, lead vocalist Michael Rose, and the late Puma Jones--backed by Sly Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare--were closing in on Bob Marley in the international pop crossover sweepstakes right up to the early 1980s. Rose's snarling ""me vex bad"" lyrical attack, as framed by Simpson and Jones's African-like harmonies and backed by the band's fierce riddim contagion, produced some of Rasta-reggae's greatest anthems--like this set's ""Happiness,"" ""World Is Africa,"" ""Push Push,"" and the title track.Sinsemillashowcases Uhuru at their most intoxicating, working rock & roll's crazed catharsis edged by roots reggae's rebel threat.--Elena Oumano"

2269948,World Peace,"One of roots reggae's institutions, Culture has cut a broad swath through Jamaican music thanks to potent political lyrics and an organic roots reggae sensibility that eschews dancehall's rough ghetto patois and digitized music making in favor of sweet-sounding vocal harmonies and live music backing. On its 30th album, the long-running outfit is still led by Joseph Hill, whose raspy sing-song vocals and rastafari political convictions touch on such subjects as oppression (""No Segregation,"" ""Sweet Freedom""), war (""World Peace""), ganja (""Bud A Bawl""), and salvation (""Holy Mount Zion"" and ""Walk In Jah Light""). Hill&#x92;s messages are nicely supported by solid, groove-driven backing from the Firehouse Crew (a great group of hired studio guns), noted Jamaican saxophonist Dean Fraser, and members of Shaggy's backing band. Culture first made its impact felt in the mid-'70s, but this album proves that Hill and company still have much to say.--Tad Hendrickson"

1908080,Jericho,"Israel Vibration have long been popular among the hippified, roots-rock-reggae crowd, and while they may not be the most innovative of artists they certainly impart a strong message of peace and positivity to their fans.Jericho, Israel Vibration's second release since the group pared itself from a trio to a duo, contains no great revelations, but it does possess an undeniable mellow charisma. With the exception of ""Jammin"" and ""Thank God It's Friday,"" both of which sound like cheesy outtakes from the soundtrack for the movieClub Paradise, the songs are meditations on African displacement. ""Gang Bang Slam"" and ""Violence"" speak on problems while ""African Unification"" and ""Move Over,"" with its call to ""get Rasta youth dem pon the scene,"" offer solutions. Indisputably, the group's energy is best experienced live; the release ofJericho, with its cultural worldview and sunny harmonies, best serves as a means to tide fans over until the next tour.--Rebecca Levine"
2060789,Original Rockers,"In retrospect, it's difficult to believe that this remarkable dub recording dates from 1979. Augustus Pablo, a musician of undervalued imagination and talent, lays down some eerie and hauntingly beautiful dub on this project, which came during the peak of his creative and commercial success. Accented by his thin, arching melodica, Pablo's dub is deep and heady, barely giving way to the percolating vocals that only suggest melodies and lyrics, rather than stating them outright.Original Rockerswas recorded at the legendary studio of the great reggae producer King Tubby, and though the recording quality varies wildly, the thoughtful, quiet dub moves forward without hesitation.--S.

135414,,"""Bob's music has always conveyed a message of hope, unity and love. It has brought countless people together as it did that night 30 years ago in Pittsburgh. To hear that music today and to be able to share it with a new generation shows that Bob is as relevant today as he was 30 years ago,"" says Rita Marley."
91686,,"An acclaimed singer, songwriter, musician and producer, Stephen Marley is a five-star general in Jah Army's ongoing offensive to uphold the integrity of reggae music. Stephen has won seven Grammy Awards for his work on various Marley family projects, including two Best Reggae Album Grammy nods for his self-produced solo efforts ""Mind Control"", which debuted atop Billboard's Reggae Album Chart, and ""Mind Control Acoustic"", a record-setting tally for a Jamaican artist. The second son born to Bob and Rita Marley, younger brother to Sharon, Cedella and Ziggy and mentor to brothers Julian, Ky-mani and Damian, Stephen's acceptance of the responsibilities inherent within his exalted familial legacy is evidenced by the consistent excellence that distinguishes his various musical endeavors. Stephen's third self produced album ""Revelation Part 1: The Root of Life"" (Ghetto Youths/Universal Republic), which will be released on May 24th, was conceived as a celebration and preservation conduit for roots rock reggae, insuring that the music's regal template is maintained throughout the 21st century. Stephen achieves that objective with 14 soulful, often times soul-bearing tracks that never sacrifice rhythmic purity in deliverance of their powerful messages: ""Revelation Part 1: The Root of Life"" provides encouragement for the struggling masses (""Working Ways""), depicts the harrowing residual effects of slavery (""Old Slaves""), evokes the sorrow of rejection (""She Knows Now""), and conveys the disappointment of ""False Friends"", the gravity of these themes offset by exquisite melodies and the subtle shadings of their musical accompaniment, as coordinated by Stephen's production expertise. Conceived as a two part project, ""The Root of Life"" will be followed by the release of ""Revelation Part 2: The Fruit of Life"", due in Autumn 2011, which features an array of styles that have emanated from reggae's core. ""Reggae music has influenced hip-hop and so many other kinds of music,"" Stephen reasons, ""so `The Fruit of Life' will be a more open, eclectic kind of record. There will be songs for the club; dancehall reggae will be there, love songs in there, but it will remain conscious good music that you can always take something positive from.""Stephen embarked on his strategic scheme to safeguard Jamaican music's standards after reading several articles criticizing current dancehall reggae hits that are preoccupied with sex and materialism and devoid of the revolutionary, empowering sentiments that were intrinsic to reggae's development in the late `60s. ""The accusations in those articles don't speak for I and I and `nuff more artists' music, but when you check what's breaking through from Jamaica, it's some two-chord, jump up party thing,"" Stephen explained during a recent visit to New York City's Quad Studios. ""There's nothing wrong with that in its appropriate time and place but to preserve the music's integrity you must have a balance. Reggae's consciousness was built on a message, a Black movement, Rastafari, and that is not being pushed today. Me know me have power with my voice and my instrument so, with that vibe, me pick up me guitar, strummed a reggae rhythm, and just started singing; from song to song, that is the spirit within this album."" Stephen and his band members rehearsed for two weeks prior to recording ""The Root of Life"" and the result is an organic, richly textured sound, anchored in reggae's scorching drum and bass backbeat, punctuated by steady guitar strums and fluid keyboard riffs, then embellished with flourishes of saxophone, flute and harmonica. ""With ""Mind Control"" I kinda put songs together but ""The Root of Life"" is a body of work,"" Stephen clarifies. ""The band came and I gave them the talk: why we need to do it, how it need to come across; we never recorded like that before and I like what we came up with all of us there together; these are the real soldiers in Jah Army."" Fittingly, the first single from this remarkable effort is ""Jah Army"", featuring Damian Marley and Buju Banton spitting formidable, career-defining verses over a thunderous one-drop rhythm intensified by soul shaking dub reverbs. ""Jah Army"" is the rallying call for troops engaged in this designated undertaking, the significance of which is further underscored on the unity anthems ""Break Us Apart"", cautioning against those who ""take you from the root and teach you their own truth"" and ""Tight Ship"", which urges all concerned parties to focus on their survival. ""This is where I speak to the soldiers in Jah Army, saying whether it's in the music or your life, get it together man, the Gideon is on,"" declares The General. Stephen Marley realized his musical mission at an early age. Born on April 20, 1972, by the time he was old enough to walk, he was dancing and singing onstage at Bob Marley and the Wailers concerts. Bob regularly took Stephen and his siblings into the recording studio so they could learn the rudiments of production and better understand the motivating forces within his work. ""My father used to tell us music is like a prayer and you don't put just anything in a prayer, you say important things, pray for people who are suffering,"" Stephen recalled. ""He'd say don't take it for a joke and if you're not really serious don't do it."" Stephen, Ziggy, Sharon and Cedella made their professional debut as The Melody Makers in 1979 with the release of the single ""Children Playing in the Streets"", written by their father. The spotlight shone on eight-year old Stephen's precocious talents the following year when he sang lead on ""Sugar Pie""; The Melody Makers' generated much excitement when they performed the song at Jamaica's Reggae Sunsplash in July 1981, staged that year in commemoration of their father's profound musical legacy, just two months after his passing. The group went on to tour the world and earned numerous awards; Stephen assisted in the production of each of The Melody Makers albums since he was a teenager including the Best Reggae Album Grammy winners ""Conscious Party"" (1989), ""One Bright Day"" (1990) and ""Fallen Is Babylon"" (1997). Since his early 20s Stephen has helmed the production for several Marley family members' albums, most notably, those by his youngest brother Damian, including ""Half Way Tree"" and ""Welcome To Jamrock"", each bestowed with a Best Reggae Album Grammy. Alongside Damian, Stephen coproduced ""Distant Relatives"", Damian and Nas's critically lauded collaborative effort, released in 2010. While working on the final mixes of ""Distant Relatives"", Stephen went into an adjoining studio and laid down a few ideas that became the bedrock of ""The Root of Life"". Just as ""Distant Relatives"" closed the cultural gap between hip-hop and dancehall reggae, Stephen sought to bridge the continental divide between Africa and the rest of the world. To fulfill that goal he recruited Nigerian-American rapper Wale who contributes a compelling verse to ""Root of Life's"" opening track ""Made In Africa"" and the cast of the Broadway hit ""Fela"", who provide the song's epic background vocals. The beauty of ""Made In Africa"" is as breathtaking as the Motherland's natural splendor yet its mood is as somber as the repeatedly cruel exploitation of her resources and her people. ""Me start read about Napolean coming from this divide and conquer the place, depriving people of the greatest riches a man can have, it's not material, it is your heritage,"" Stephen reasoned. ""Go to Europe and see how much thing dem take out of Africa; it was the richest place `pon earth, civilization start there. That is why the song is called ""Made in Africa"" because we're all made in Africa."" Africa was of great significance in Bob Marley's music, as the ancestral home of Rastafari and even reggae itself. Stephen pays homage to his father's musical teachings by reinterpreting three songs recorded by the original Wailers (Bob, Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh) in the late 60s: the melodic liberation anthem ""Freedom Time""; the doo-wop flavored love lament ""Pale Moonlight"" and a hymn to Rastafarian Lord and Savior Haile Selassie I, ""The Chapel"" (featuring Ziggy Marley), its meditation enhanced by traditional Rastafarian Nyabinghi drumming. ""The messages here need to be heard again and we always hope that people can feel the connection and transition of our father's spirit in us when we sing these songs,"" observes Stephen, whose skillful application of his band's magisterial one-drop grooves provides these decades-old songs with a rejuvenated appeal. The Root's second single ""No Cigarette Smoking"" is a luscious duet, in reggae's lovers-rock tradition, with M&#xE9;lanie Fiona's sultry crooning complementing Stephen's raspier tone. Seemingly a contrast to the album's more militant observations, the song is a denouncement of cigarettes and alcohol stemming from the tenets of Stephen's Rastafarian way of life, which he initially wrote 15 years ago. Stephen's spirit is as irrepressible as the rollicking reggae-blues rhythm, punctuated by a wailing harmonica on ""Can't Keep I Down"". His triumphant exclamation of ""I'll always be around"", (evoking Bob's prescient lyric ""they can't get me outta the race"" from ""Bad Card""), no doubt alludes to the timeless allure of the songs he has presented here.The Root of Life concludes with ""Now I Know"", a contemplative song about moving on, (""nothing is permanent in life, all except for change""), whether by choice or by imposed circumstances, with Stephen's evocative phrasing the aural equivalent of a tearful heart. Stephen describes the song's acoustic jazz seasoning, delivered through moodily plunked piano chords, and weeping guitar strands as ""transitional, to take you out of The Root a little bit and tastefully into The Fruit"". ""The Fruit"" is what blossoms into different colors and shades,"" Stephen offers in reference to the second installment in the ""Revelation of Life"" series, ""but `The Root' has to stand predominant."""
1902034,Ultimate Collection,"Black Uhuru can claim big things in reggae history. Winners of the first Grammy Award for best reggae album (forAnthem), Black Uhuru tookBob Marley's punching rhythms and hardened them further, thanks to the duo ofbassist Robbie Shakespeare and drummer Sly Dunbar. Singer Michael Rose also had a raggy voice, which was coarse and impassioned like Marley's--and had a great alter ego in vocalist Sandra ""Puma"" Jones. This generous 77-minute set of classic Uhuru includes the major points: ""I Love King Selassie,"" ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,"" ""Utterance,"" ""Youth of Eglington."" The melodic flow and harmony-vocal crosscut of the lattermost tune stood far and away above so much reggae of the era with an adroit mix of old-school rootsiness and creative expression. Alas, the lineup that cut the tune would break apart gradually, first with the 1984 departure of Rose (replaced by Junior Reed), and then in 1986 with the departure of Jones--who succumbed to cancer in 1990. The vast majority of these 17 tracks, though, come from the Rose/Island Records era, and for that, the collection indeed amounts to ""ultimate"" as its title claims.--Andrew Bartlett"

These 52 tracks, however, derive mainly from the late 1970s, when he was at the height of his considerable powers and recording hits like Max Romeo's ""War in a Babylon"" and Junior Murvin's ""Police and Thieves"" for Island.

1378288,East of the River Nile,"The late Horace Swaby, a.k.a.Augustus Pablo, was one of the canonical figures of Jamaican reggae and dub music. From the moment he emerged on the scene as a teenager with his hit single ""Java"" to the classics he cut with his influential Rockers band and label, Pablo made the melodica, an obscure mouth organ of European origin, an indispensable part of the reggae sound. That instrument's piercing and poetic strains made this memorable out-of-print-classic, originally released in 1977 and rereleased in honor of its 25th anniversary, a marvel of sound and soul. Recorded in Lee Perry's legendary Black Ark Studio and mixed by the Scientist of SoundKing Tubby, Pablo--who also plays keyboards--is backed by a first-rate band that includes Robbie Shakespeare on bass, drummer Aston ""Family Man"" Barrett, and guitarist Earl ""Chinna"" Smith. Pablo and company deliver a nondub instrumental album that serves as the syncopated soundtrack of the Rasta nation. Who could forget the minor-key Afro anthems ""Chant to King Selassie I,"" ""Natural Way,"" and ""Jah-Light""? Along with shout outs from Perry, the Orb, and others, the CD also includes six bonus tracks and a never-before-heard version of the title cut.

1101493,King Tubbys Meets Rockers Uptown Deluxe Edition,"During the early '70s, a maverick Jamaican producer known as King Tubby (aka Osbourne Ruddock -- he was born in Kingston in 1941) embarked upon a series of pivotal recordings, ultimately creating a reggae offshoot called dub. First, he pared his forces down to a drum kit and bass and slowed the tempo until a bottom-heavy, primal heartbeat emerged. Over this framework, spare vocal and instrumental riffs emerged from layers of echoing reverb and artful distortion, erecting atmospheric soundscapes bound for infinity. This classic album is a primer for how Tubby could harness raw rhythmic power through his subtle, imaginative grasp of texture and dynamics. A potent rhythm team, including Robbie Shakespeare (one half of the famed Sly & Robbie combo) on bass, Earl ""Chinna"" Smith on guitar, and a rough-and-ready brass section, surrounds the organ-piano and clavinet (mouth-blown keyboard clarinet) of Augustus Pablo with hip, stylish Kingstonian street-bred attitude.--Christina Roden"

Spearheading this sea change during what would become known as the Dancehall era, were two of the island's most respected musicians who had learned their trade performing on countless sessions for the cream of Kingston's producers: Sly Dunbar (drums) and Robbie Shakespeare (bass). Following the launch of their Taxi imprint in 1979, Jamaica's so-called `Riddim Twins' quickly became established as the island's most innovative and successful producers, issuing a series of hugely popular 45s.

And rarely has his music, which has always been locked into a hypnotic groove, sounded so upbeat, punctuated with bouncing horn lines--it's almost as if he's announcing that he's back, and happy to be here. While his voice isn't quite the instrument it was in the late '70s, it's still strong and supple, and there's plenty of vocal support--almost a return to the days of Burning Spear (the band) in the use of call-and-response singing.

1036570,Free to Move,"Ziggy Marley may have a voice that sounds uncannily like his father's, but musically it's Israel Vibration who carry Bob's legacy into the '90s. A couple years ago, onThe Rockalbum, they had reached a peak (no pun intended), a wonderful mix of the sweet and serious. ButFree to Movetakes a leap beyond that, and marks them as serious contenders to achieve the same sort of mass adulation as their inspiration. Like Bob, they never forget where they're from, and so you get the political bent of &quot;Terrorist&quot; and &quot;System not Working,&quot; scathing words over a beat that skanks like it was just born. And then they stir it up with &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; (and yes, it does owe a debt to Roy Orbison) and the glorious &quot;Feelin' Irie,&quot; which sounds so much like mid-'70s wailers that it could almost be part of their work. Not that Israel Vibration are retro. They simply make truly classic, and truly classy, reggae that stands outside space and time. Forget the bastardized crap of dancehall and ragga; this is the real thing.--Chris Nickson"
958,Uprising,"1980 album from the Reggae legend, the last studio offering to be released during his lifetime. This album is one of Marley's most directly religious, with nearly every song addressing his Rastafarian beliefs, culminating in the acoustic folk classic, ""Redemption Song"".."
598785,Burnin,"In the wake of reggae's breakthrough into rock awareness with the Robin Hood saga,The Harder They Come, the soundtrack that first rooted the music's sultry push beat and seductive patois in the underclass struggles of modern Jamaica erupted forcefully on this 1973 classic--The Wailers' second album targeting beyond their underground to fresh, impressionable rock fans. What was a revelation to rockers was really the work of a seasoned band captured on the eve of internal upheaval: Trenchtown stars since the late '60s, the band's most charismatic member, Bob Marley, loomed as its perceived frontman, a development which hastened the departures of Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer and madeBurnin'the final statement from that earlier configuration. The original version of &quot;I Shot the Sheriff,&quot; which had spread reggae's outlaw ethos and staccato, propulsive sound on Eric Clapton's hit cover, is more than matched by the anthemic &quot;Get Up, Stand Up,&quot; the call-to-arms of &quot;Burnin' And Lootin',&quot; the Rastafarian pride of &quot;Rasta Man Chant,&quot; as well as strong remakes of &quot;Small Axe&quot; and &quot;Duppy Conqueror.&quot;--Sam Sutherland"
1522092,One Love at Studio One 1964-1966,"This two-CD compilation chronicles the urgent and early artistry of Peter Tosh, Bunny Wailer, and of course, Bob Marley. These historic sessions, recorded at the legendary Studio One in Kingston, showcase the embryonic stage of the Wailers band, backed by the Skatalites, The Mighty Vikings, Rita Marley, Junior Braithwaite, and many of Jamaica's finest musicians. Even on these old discs, Marley steals the show with his riveting and revolutionary vocals, as evidenced by the pulsing, prehistoric renditions of ""Simmer Down,"" ""Hooligan Ska,"" and his anthem ""One Love."" Several unreleased tracks and alternate takes--like Marley and company's riff on the Beatles' ""And I Love Her,"" and a rare rehearsal track, ""Wages of Love""--reveal their stylistic range and work ethic. To put it in evolutionary terms, this collection traces reggae's musical and philosophical DNA down to its R&B;, doo-wop, Rastafarian, ska, and rock steady roots.--Eugene Holley, Jr."

Disc Two of Burnin' Deluxe Edition features the complete previously unreleased Wailers performance recorded at Leeds Polytechnic on November 23, 1973, near the end of the band's tour of England. This concert - one of the Wailers' last shows with Tosh - offers a fascinating glimpse into this otherwise undocumented phase of the band's history. At Leeds, the Wailers deliver a punchy, soulful set, including four Burnin' highlights, along with the Catch A Fire tracks ""Slave Driver,"" ""Stop That Train,"" ""Midnight Ravers,"" ""No More Trouble,"" ""Kinky Reggae"" & ""Stir It Up."" Also included is Peter Tosh's ""You Can't Blame the Youth"" & a 13-minute rendition of ""Lively Up Yourself,"" an early song that Marley would revive on the following year's Natty Dread album. Burnin' Deluxe Edition is packaged in a deluxe 2CD digipak housed within a plastic slipcase.

923942,Louisville Slugger MLB180 Natural Wood Baseball Bat,"Don't make the mistake of thinking all wood bats are the same. They may look similar, but the quality of the wood is very different from one wood bat company to another. Louisville Slugger, however, sets itself apart from other bat makers with more than 120 years of bat-making experience, outstanding turning models, and access to the best-quality wood on the market. The MLB180 bat, for instance, is made of professional-grade ash, pound for pound the strongest timber available. Ash offers a flexibility that isn't found in other timbers, including maple, resulting in a barrel that tends to flex rather than break. This gives you a larger, more forgiving sweet spot in terms of breakage. In addition, ash is lighter than maple, so players can choose from among several large-barrel sizes. It all adds up to a terrific choice for casual players who love the look and feel of a genuine wood bat, or professionals who value a high-quality bat performance.The MLB180 also boasts a randomly selected turning model, with such possibilities as C271, P72, C243, R161, T141, and K55.Bat SpecificationsWood: AshFinish: NaturalLength: 32, 33, or 34 inchesTurning model: C271, P72, C243, R161, T141, or K55Note:The biggest factors that influence the life of a wood bat are the quality of wood and where the ball hits your bat. Until you gain experience hitting with wood bats, however, don't be surprised if you break a lot of bats. Unlike with aluminum bats, when you hit a ball along the handle or at the end of a wood bat, you may break the bat rather than get a hit. It takes a lot of practice, but with work, you will find that you break fewer bats and become a much better hitter.About Louisville SluggerIn many ways, the rich 120-year history of the Louisville Slugger baseball bat began in the talented hands of 17-year-old John A. ""Bud"" Hillerich. Bud's father, J.F. Hillerich, owned a woodworking shop in Louisville in the 1880s when Bud began working for him. Legend has it that Bud slipped away from work one afternoon in 1884 to watch the Louisville Eclipse, the town's major league team. After Pete Browning--the Eclipse's star who was mired in a hitting slump--broke his bat, Bud invited him to his father's shop to make a new one. With Browning at his side giving advice, Bud handcrafted a new bat from a long slab of wood. Browning got three hits using the bat the next day. Browning told his teammates, which began a surge of professional ballplayers visiting the Hillerich shop.Although J.F. Hillerich had little interest in making bats, Bud persisted, eventually registering the name Louisville Slugger with the U.S. patent office in 1894. In the early 1900s, the company was one of the first to use a sports endorsement as a marketing strategy, paying Hall of Famer Honus Wagner to use his name on a bat. By 1923, Louisville Slugger was the selling more bats than any other bat maker in the country, with such famed clients as Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, and Lou Gehrig. In the ensuing years, the company has sold more than 100 million bats, and 60 percent of all Major League players currently use Louisville Sluggers. The company now sells far more than bats, including fielding and batting gloves, helmets, catchers' gear, equipment bags, training aids, and accessories."

It is now used as a general purpose utility cord by both military personnel and civilians. The soft braided outer shell is durable yet cushioned, allowing this cord to be flexible so it is the perfect wrap for knife handles, spears and survival gear. The braided sheath has a high number of interwoven strands for its size, giving it a relatively smooth texture. The all nylon construction makes paracord fairly elastic. This versatile cord was even used by astronauts during STS-82, the second Space Shuttle mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope. The inner nylon cords are made from high-tenacity, light resistant and heat-resistant polyamide. It has a melting point of 244 degrees Celsius. The inner nylon cords loose no more than 15 percent of their original breaking strength after exposure to heat and light. In addition to purely utility functions, paracord can be used to fashion knotted or braided bracelets, lanyards, belts and other decorative items. 550 Cord is used by many U.S. military members as a bracelet signifying deployment to the Central Command Area of Responsibility, typically countries in the Middle East.

170088,Apple iPhone 4 16GB (A1332) - GSM Factory Unlocked - No Warranty (Black),"This phone can be restored within iTunes and is compatible with all versions of iOS7. This product does not have a manufacturer warranty rather a 30-day return period with seller. At just 9.3mm, the iPhone 4 is thin as a rake but the front and back are 30 times stronger than the usual plastic. Reason - aluminosilicate glass, the stuff that windshields of military choppers are made of. The periphery is customized alloy, 5 times stronger than steel. Your accidental dropping won't hurt your pocket-communicator. The Retina Display packs in 4 times the amount of pixels (326 per inch) of iPhone 3, and makes the text and images slicing sharp. Thanks to the added 960 x 640 pixel screen watching of HD movies on the iPhone 4 becomes a gasp. When you become a shutterbug behind the iPhone 4 camera, you shoot 5 megapixel images and high-definition videos at 720p resolution, with the LED flash and autofocus that make things easier. Opt for the iMovie video editing software, and you become a movie maker. If you happen to have Wi-Fi around, the FaceTime feature gets you into true worldwide video chat and 'staying in touch' becomes real personal. And all it takes to choose between the front and rear camera is a tap. The 3-axis gyro, when coupled with accelerometer, results in 6-axis motion sensing, and that's as good as it can ever get for gaming on a cell phone. With 7 hours of talk time (3G)/10 hours of video/40 hours of audio, the iPhone 4 packs in enough power to let you do fast multitasking."

589150,Helvetica and the New York City Subway System: The True (Maybe) Story,"""The book is a must read for sign nuts, design nuts, transit nuts, and all true lovers of New York."" --Julia Turner,Slate""A concise history of the New York subway, a visual archive of century's worth of underground signs (some of which are still in use), and an impressive study of the conflict between the purity of design and the messiness of the real world."" --The Wilson Quarterly""[D]esign projects are rarely tidy; they're much likelier to be muddled, chaotic, and to be determined by flukes, gaffes and compromises as much as forethought. It's always refreshing to come across an unexpurgated account of the messy reality, and the American design historian Paul Shaw has produced a particularly thoughtful and engaging example in his new book,Helvetica and the New York City Subway System."" --Alice RawsthornThe New York Times""Mr. Shaw makes clear in one of the best-researched books on modern design to date, this most New York of places is today a realm dominated by a Swiss typeface specified by a pair of Italian designers. There isn't better testimony to the city as a melting pot or to the strange turns that any major design project inevitably takes."" --The Wall Street Journal""For transit and type nerds alike, Paul's book is the Bible. It finally tells the true story of the New York subway sign system and shows how even big projects like it are shaped by people and their likes and dislikes; by accidents, prejudice, and half-knowledge. This is a history book, a type book, a design book, and a business book."" --Erik Spiekermann, creative director and managing partner, Edenspiekermann""Paul Shaw's detailed narrative of the evolution of signage in the New York City subway system over the past half-century reveals how the many decisions underlying its appearance have been shaped as much by political, economic, and bureaucratic forces as by design considerations. His beautifully illustrated book brings a unique perspective to the subject, and is a welcome addition to the vast literature on New York City."" --Kenneth T. Jackson, Editor-in-Chief,The Encyclopedia of New York City; President Emeritus, The New-York Historical Society""Paul Shaw's story of the New York subway sign system is an amazing piece of research. While Helvetica vs. Standard is the book's main focus, the most intriguing part of the story has to with the decisions and personalities involved. Shaw wonderfully captures the complexity of the undertaking, and shows how the persistence of a few people dedicated to expanding and improving the system over many years had a great impact."" --Tom Geismar, founding partner, Chermayeff & Geismar""Paul Shaw's study of the signage in the New York subway system is one of the best pieces of design history I've ever read. Impeccably researched and gracefully written, it uses a seemingly prosaic subject as a starting point for a fascinating exploration of the way that graphic design developed as a discipline in the 20th century."" --Michael Bierut, partner, Pentagram"

Perfect for trips to the lake, river, waterpark and beach, these will save your phone from accidents that tend to happen during the fun in the sun.

During installation, make sure all of the seals and o-rings seat well, otherwise leaks may result. Keep your ringer switch on as well, so the case fits best. Careful about dropping this case. It's cheaper than the $70 ones both in price and quality, so you'll have to baby it. If you drop it hard, it certainly could break and cause leaks.

532905,"Franklin, Jefferson, &amp; Madison: on Religion and the State (U.S. Constitution &amp; Bill of Rights)","The product of twenty years of careful research in the National Archives, Library of Congress, and other libraries, this book presents views on a national theme, ""Religion and the State."" The ideas of Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison on Church-State issues, as well as their personal religious views, reflect the roots of religion in America. The Founders&#x92; ideas on the ""free exercise of religion"" illuminate their original intent regarding our First Amendment rights.Dr. Franklin recommended public prayer at the Constitutional Convention. Jefferson recommended to children that they read the Bible. Madison felt strongly that government officials should not interfere with our private lives. While respecting the value of religion, they supported separation of Church and State.Church-State issues remain hotly debated. The national media regularly covers related topics: ""Faith-based Initiatives,"" ""Prayer in Schools,"" ""In God We Trust,"" ""Public Displays of Ten Commandments,"" and more.Because Franklin, Jefferson, and Madison played such key roles in the creation of the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights, their writings are especially important. When they speak to the ""original intent"" of the founders, their documents provide direct evidence for interpreting our Constitutional rights. This is the kind of evidence sometimes considered by Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court to determine the ""original intent"" of the Constitution.Religious freedom is important to people around the world. However, not everyone enjoys the same protections offered under the U.S. Constitution. This book may be especially meaningful to people still striving to achieve freedom of religion. For those struggling under religious persecution, we hope the visions of Franklin, Jefferson, and Madison will inspire courage and self-determination."

Izzy, Miriam, their mom, and their community make a sincere effort to reflect on their own behavior, to apologize to those they have wronged, and to offer forgiveness to those who have wronged them. The setting is based on the annual tradition at Manhattan Beach, CA. Poetic text and flowing autumnal illustrations support the contemplative nature of the tale. Emotions ring true: Izzy nervously puts off difficult apologies, but experiences a clean, wide-open heart once he has spoken up. At the same time, the characters are real and human: despite their efforts to be good, Izzy and Miriam quarrel, as siblings will. A short author's note provides background about the holiday, but the story will be best appreciated by children already familiar with these traditions. However, the universality of emotion and the quality presentation make this book a good choice for multicultural New Year celebrations.&ndash;Heidi Estrin, Feldman Children's Library at Congregation B'nai Israel, Boca Raton, FLCopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Changes in text are slight; the big transformation is in the book's overall appearance. The characters have been given an updated, more cartoonlike look, with new hairstyles and casual clothing. Gender and ethnic representation is more balanced, and the figures are more active. A baby formerly being held and fed is now feeding himself a bottle, Elizabeth has escaped her confining highchair, and readers see Sam brushing his teeth morning and night, rather than just a sketch of the sun and moon. But the biggest change is in the parents. Yesterday's stay-at-home Mom, in bathrobe, rollers, and lipstick, and Dad, in his business suit, have been replaced by a couple enjoying themselves at a picnic.

Yet Egyptian mythology remains somewhat ignored, making the content of this book, while familiar, feel quite fresh. It begins with a brief introduction to the genesis of Egyptian culture and a primer on its glyphs and naming conventions. Creation stories and enmeshed tales of a panoply of gods are told in a highly stylized way. (An illustrated cast of characters in the back matter clarifies the confusing litany of deities.) Balit&#x2019;s Egyptian-styled illustrations are spectacular and given a proper sandstone-and-tile border. Egyptian mythology is not nearly as common as its Greek and Roman counterparts, but is every bit as engaging, lyrical, and reflective of the cultural beliefs of the civilization in which it finds its origins. This hefty compendium should offer something new for the most ardent mythology fans. Grades 5-8. --Erin Anderson"
26027,Science in Ancient Egypt (Science of the Past),"Grade 5-8 The accomplishments of ancient Egyptians in architecture, medicine, astronomy, mathematics, and agriculture are presented in a clear and concise manner. A concluding chapter summarizes the more visible parts of modern everyday life which owe their beginnings to Egypt. For example, the Egyptians were the first to design locks with a notched key matching pegs within the lock and were responsible for our sun-based calendar. Woods is careful to point out where our knowledge of Egyptian technology is incomplete, such as techniques used for shaping stones, and he describes several probable alternative methods. The paucity of illustrations is a weakness. Those that have been included are often incomplete or fail to deal with the processes being described. Still, this is a good general introduction, which should be followed up by books that focus on specific aspects of Egyptian civilization, such as Mildred Pace's Wrapped for Eternity (McGraw, 1974; o.p.) and David Macaulay's Pyramid (Houghton, 1975).

Like a long-limbed little bird--all twiggy arms and legs--Tessie moves through the neighborhood, observing her Mamma, her friends, the skies, even the streets:Up and down the block,cats pant,heat wavers off tar patches in the broiling alleyway....I stare out over rooftops,past chimneys, into the way off distance.And that's when I see it coming,clouds rolling in,gray clouds, bunched and bulging under a purple sky.A creeper of hope circles round my bones.""Come on, rain!""

However, the single-page sections covering indigenous religions from Africa, North America, and Australia are less useful because of their brevity.

A few well-placed photographs add to the text: sacred places such as the Lingaraj temple in India, an ancient mosque in Cordoba, and the Temple of Heaven in Beijing, and sacred objects such as a reclining Buddha in Thailand, a Muslim mihrab (prayer alcove), and an Australian Aboriginal painting.

258777,Kindness: A Treasury of Buddhist Wisdom for Children and Parents (This Little Light of Mine),"""Many American children know the parable of the mustard seed told in the New Testament. Few, however, have been exposed to the equally compelling Buddhist story of the mustard seed. In this parable, the Buddha tells a woman who has lost her child to seek out mustard seeds from families that have not been exposed to death. In doing so, the woman learns the universality of grief. Thirty-one such stories have been masterfully adapted and translated by Conover to transmit the soft, lyrical voice of the originals. These include Jataka tales, stories of the Buddha in past incarnations, which are widely read and retold to Buddhist children throughout the world. Populated with sticky-haired dragons, verbose monkeys, and strange-looking monks, and illustrated in pleasant, sepia-tone pictures contributed by Valerie Wahl,Kindnessis packed with excellent tales that will surprise and delight readers while introducing them to the diversity of religious traditions."" -John Green,Booklist""Most of these 32 stories are only a few pages long, and the longer ones seem drawn out. Wry, rather than humorous, many are less-known Jataka tales. The traditions of India, Japan, and Tibet are well represented, while China and other Buddhist-influenced countries are not. Although many of these stories resemble fables, their level of language as well as the parablelike meanings demand skillful readers. Oblique as many tales are, readers must be good interpreters, alert to implications. The vocabulary (""asceticism,"" ""gratification,"" ""enlightenment"") in the ""Young Reader"" introductions signals is level of sophistication. The narrative style is sometimes arch (""sprite,"" ""thee""), sometimes moralizing. The dozen full-page illustration are fine line drawings, whose realistic style helps ground these spiritual anecdotes. Each story is preceded by a wise ""saying,"" providing attractive and accessible nuggets of Buddhist thought. Sources for sayings and stories appear in a valuable annotated bibliography. this is not a complete introduction to the religion, but its ethos, much as a collection of parables would be for Christianity. Although there are several similar compilations in print, the growth of Buddhism in the U.S. might provide a demand for this one, too."" -Patricia Lothrop,School Library Journal"

106468,The Wheel on the School,"Grade 3-6-Although a bit slow-paced, this 1955 Newbery Award-winner by Meindert DeJong (Harper, 1954) is pleasant and positive. Curious schoolgirl Lina wonders why there are no longer any storks in her Dutch village. Determined to lure the storks (symbols of good fortune) back, Lina inspires the whole community to cooperate and get to know each other better in their effort to locate wheels in which storks can nest. Lina is a spunky girl who does not give up on her dream. The characters are likeable and get into dangerous and suspenseful situations. Their names may sound strange to the American ear (e.g., Auka, Jella, Eelka). Listeners will learn something about Danish culture while enjoying the story. It will take a while for students to get used to narrator Anne Flosnik's British accent. The narration is steady in tempo, and she changes her voice for different characters.Erin Caskey, Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County, OHCopyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to theAudio Cassetteedition."

89695,"""Tut's Mummy: Lost...and Found (Step into Reading)""","Kindergarten-Grade 3 Donnelly gives simple details about how King Tutankhamen was buried and the ancient Egyptians beliefs about death. The story then skips ahead to the 1800s, when Howard Carter's frustrating five-year search for Egyptian treasure finally resulted in his discovery of the young pharoah's tomb. Although there's little new information here, these true tales of mummies and ancient treasure in an easy-reader format should prove popular. Ventura and Ceserani's In Search of Tutankhamum (Silver Burdett, 1985) provides a more detailed account of Carter's struggles, and its illustrations are superior to the standard textbook drawings found here. But its nice to see photos of the Egyptian finds included in this book, which will help readers share the excitement that Carter must have felt when his dream of finding an ancient tomb finally came true.

It is unmatched for cleaning firearms and minimizes the need for brushing and scraping barrels and chambers. It forms a protective film on the surface of metals and is capable of creeping into the finest cracks and fissures making Ballistol and excellent ""penetrant"" to help loosen frozen nuts and bolts. It will even protect wet surfaces! Unlike most lubricants, Ballistol emulsifies with water; when the water evaporates, Ballistol stays behind to protect the metal, plastic, wood or leather. Ballistol will keep all smooth leathers soft and moisturized (do not use on suede). It is also non-toxic and biodegradable; neither its use, disposal or decomposition will produce any byproducts that are harmful to the environment. Coca Cola and many of Germany's famous breweries use Ballistol as does Bizerba, one of the largest precision scale manufacturers, who specifies Ballistol because it never gets sticky or increases friction over time. It's also a great silver and brass polish. Human sweat and skin oils are slightly acidic; their effect is similar to the etching process. Ballistol is slightly alkaline and neutralizes this effect. Of course Ballistol is also perfect for all the household chores any normal oil will do, but why settle for a ""normal"" oil when you can have one product that does so much more."

1556595,Leonard Bernstein: A Jewish Legacy (Milken Archive of American Jewish Music),"Leonard Bernstein occupies a unique position in the music world for his protean, multi-faceted talents. His ability to draw on and absorb every cultural influence made him the ultimate eclectic, yet he eventually forged a style that was unmistakably his own. This record, which includes vocal, choral and instrumental pieces, some never recorded, performed or published, demonstrates that his Jewish heritage played a formative, lasting, decisive role in this process. The earliest, Psalm 148 (sung in English), written when he was 17, is steeped in an ultra-romantics style, especially Wagner's; it hardly contains a hint of the later Bernstein, but its innocent sweetness is infinitely touching. The longest, Halil, is a virtuoso piece for flute with piano and percussion, written 1981 in memory of a 19-year-old Israeli flutist killed 1973 in the Yom Kippur War. Also written for specific occasions and friends are Silhouette for Jennie Tourel's birthday and Three Wedding Dances for the marriage of Adolph Greene and Phyllis Newman. Excerpts from longer works include At My Wedding from Arias and Barcarolles, a description of a young fiddler playing for a wedding that is both funny and affecting, sung in Yiddish, a chorus from the ballet The Dybbuk, a section of Concerto for Orchestra. These, like several sacred selections--prayers, invocations, hymns of thanks and praise for various parts of the Service--are sung in Hebrew. The most substantial is Hashkiveinu, a prayer for peace, commissioned by the Cantor of a New York synagogue, for tenor solo, chorus and organ, featuring call and response, cantorial chanting and very daring harmonies and tonal juxtapositions. Bernstein later recycled some of this material for other, very different compositions, like films and musicals, perhaps indicating that he considered this style the connecting thread of his creative life. The performances are uniformly excellent; R&#xE9;aux, Blochwitz and the pianists stand out.--Edith Eisler"
103304,"""In the Fiddler's House""","In his introductory note to this CD, Itzhak Perlman informs us that, more than anything else he has recorded, this is truly his own music--&quot;what you might hear if you came to my house and I decided to jam with some friends.&quot; And jam he does--with some very talented friends indeed. Klezmer music, which combines the folk and religious music of Yiddish-speaking cultures with various musical traditions of countries such as Russia, Turkey, and Greece, is unusual territory for a major label and a superstar artist, but here the combination works perfectly. Perlman, who normally is the star of his recordings, just blends into the whole celebration. The playing of violin, accordion, mandolin, clarinet, and other instruments is stylish, infectious, and at times virtuosic. Strangely, the sound lacks openness, inhibiting the characteristically vibrant timbres of these instruments.--David Vernier"
43126,Like Dreamers: The Story of the Israeli Paratroopers Who Reunited Jerusalem and Divided a Nation,"*Starred Review* It is probably the most iconic photograph of the 1967 Six-Day War&#x2014;a group of Israeli paratroopers gazing upward with a look of wonder at the sacred Western Wall, the surviving remnant of the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE. These were men of Brigade 55, a reserve unit primarily responsible for liberating the wall and seizing East Jerusalem from Jordanian control. The photo and the Israeli victory engendered an immediate sense of pride, joy, and euphoria that enveloped Israeli and Diaspora Jews, left and right, secular and religious. Since then, of course, the conquest of Jerusalem and the West Bank (Judea and Samaria) has been rather a poisoned pill, dividing Israel politically as it rules over a huge Arab population. Halevi is an American-born Israeli journalist and a promoter of Jewish-Arab reconciliation. Here he tracks the subsequent lives of seven of the Brigade 55 members. Some became staunch proponents of settlement activity on Palestinian land and some became members of the left-wing Peace Now movement. One even helped create an anti-Zionist underground movement. Halevi succeeds in his broader goal of linking these men and their families to Israel&#x2019;s history during the past five decades. This is a beautifully written and sometimes heartbreaking account of these men, their families, and their nation. --Jay Freeman"

84890,Duets: An American Classic,"At this point, who else but Tony Bennett would have the clout to round up stars on the scale of Elton John, Paul McCartney, Bono, Celine Dion and Barbra Streisand for some duets? (Note also that unlike some similar projects, all the parties involved on this CD were alive when it was recorded!) The material consists of relatively obvious classics in standard big-band arrangements, and Bennett himself is in top form at age 80, so much so that he doesn't need anybody else to handle ""I Left My Heart in San Francisco."" But the fun comes from checking out how his collaborators fare. The Dixie Chicks provide wonderful Andrews Sisters&#x96;type harmonies on the percolating version of ""Lullaby of Broadway"" that opens the festivities. The best songs tend to be the ones where Bennett's slightly craggy voice is juxtaposed to smooth female ones, like Diana Krall on ""The Best Is Yet to Come,"" familiar accomplice k.d. lang on the sultry ""Because of You"" and Streisand&#x97;-perhaps Bennett's only equal in stature at this point&#x97;on ""Smile."" Among the less expected guests, soulman John Legend is a revelation on the hard-swinging ""Sing, You Sinners,"" while George Michael confirms he&#x92;s quite the crooner on ""How Do You Keep the Music Playing?"" Elvis Costello, Celine Dion or Juanes don't sound as comfortable, and sometimes it feels as if they overdo it to compensate, but overall this collection is among the best of its kind, with most guests rising to the occasion.--Elisabeth Vincentelli"

Not only did her career parallel some of the 20th-century s most tumultuous events--the Russian Revolution, the rise of Nazism, and the volatile politics of South America--her career was directly affected by their outcome. Despite personal trauma and political turmoil, Kremer never backed down from controversy, took the easy path, or surrendered to pressure to stop performing in Yiddish."

2343390,1941: The Year That Keeps Returning,"During WWII, a Nazi-backed regime ruled Croatia, with deadly consequences for hundreds of thousands. One of those was the father of Goldstein, who recounts his family&#x2019;s experiences during the horrific period. Goldstein, 13 when Germany installed the Ustasha regime in 1941, and his younger brother had a resourceful mother who sensed the imminence of roundups and arranged the eventual flight of the family to the refuge of the Communist Partisans. Goldstein&#x2019;s father, however, vanished into the regime&#x2019;s prison camps, a mystery Goldstein investigates amid a recollection of how his friends, schoolmates, and neighbors in his hometown, Karlovac, responded to the Ustasha regime and its persecutions of Jews and Serbs. Representing a range from fanatical nationalists to cynical opportunists, this gallery of Goldstein&#x2019;s acquaintances captures the atmosphere of genocide on a chillingly interpersonal scale. Meeting some such people decades later at a book trade convention, Goldstein matter-of-factly remarks on their avoidance of the truth of 1941&#x2019;s massacres in Croatia. Based on his personal story, Goldstein&#x2019;s brave reconstruction of the massacres and their successor atrocities in 1945 and the 1990s should be added to the Holocaust shelf. --Gilbert Taylor"

1209256,Forbidden Broadway (20th Anniversary Edition),"It's hard to believe that the Great White Way has now suffered through 20&nbsp;years of abuse from the legendary off-Broadway revueForbidden Broadway. Since June 1981, the formula has been the same: take the most familiar and popular numbers from Broadway shows, add wickedly hilarious lyrics by creator Gerard Alessandrini and spot-on impressions by talented performers, and put the audience in stitches. Obviously, parodies of specific people (Patti LuPone,Mandy Patinkin,Julie Andrews) and specific shows (The Lion King,Les Miz,Ragtime) can get dated quickly, but because so many of the original performances are preserved on recordings, Broadway fans should recognize most, if not all, the references. This 20th-anniversary edition includes highlights from the first five volumes (though the medleys have been slightly truncated for this 74-minute recording), making it an excellent introduction for novices, plus seven previously unreleased tracks that longtime fans won't want to miss, including some old targets (Sarah Brightman) and some new ones, such asMartin Guerre(""Look, I'm Martin Guerre&nbsp;/ And I confess, this show's a mess, just like my hair"") andLiza Minnelli's 1999-2000 comeback show.

The documentary is not fawning; testimony from collaborators such as Debbie Reynolds and Andr&#xE9; Previn leaves no doubt about his vanity and his perfectionism. The best of the interviewees is the actress Betsy Blair, Kelly's first wife, whose intelligence and frankness reflect well on him.

Much of the film focuses on the illegal immigrants who work in the loosely regulated meat-packing industry, and actors including the luminous Catalina Sandino Moreno (Maria Full of Grace), who plays a desperate but outraged laborer. Greg Kinnear also delivers a spot-on performance as a fast-food chain marketing manager, trying frantically to discover the source of stomach-turning contamination in the company's meat. Stories are woven in unexpected ways, and cameos by the likes of Kris Kristofferson, Patricia Arquette, and especially Bruce Willis keep the narrative fresh. The film has a point of view, but thanks to Linklater's deft touch, is never didactic. As Willis's character slyly says, ""Most people don't like to be told what's best for them.""

The entirety of the book is a passionate and convincing case for that ideal diet. Campbell has not written a book of diet tips, or even provided recipes. In fact, at times the book delves so deeply into scientific process&mdash; for example, explaining how cancer develops or how metabolism works&mdash;that many may find themselves having to read slowly to understand his point. Yet he makes the case that Americans are too prone to take pills to solve health issues (and doctors too prone to prescribe them) as a result of ""reductionist thinking"". His years of scientific study and calm, measured tone are highly convincing, making a firm case that changing one's diet is the best way to assure good health.

42820,Healing Back Pain Naturally: The Mind-Body Program Proven to Work,"After abusing his back for years, Brownstein, a practicing physician, turned to conventional medicine for relief. Surgery did not reduce the pain and led to an ongoing use of strong painkillers. Frustrated, Brownstein embarked on his own self-healing journey. The knowledge he acquired from yoga, meditation, diet, relaxation, and deep breathing was channeled into a program he calls Back To Life. Unlike the quick fixes offered by conventional medicine, Brownstein's program works holistically and requires changing unhealthy life patterns. He introduces the reader to a stretching program and strengthening exercises (demonstrated in black-and-white photos), then covers stress management, nutrition, return to work, and the psycho-spiritual elements of recovery. This is a readable book, less blunt than John Sarno's groundbreaking Healing Back Pain: The Mind-Body Connection (Warner, 1991). Back pain sufferers disappointed by conventional approaches will want this.

He segued from patient to physical therapist, and now runs a famous clinic in San Diego, where he claims he's helped 95 percent of his patients cure chronic pain--including Jack Nicklaus and Charles Barkley, whose athletic careers he helped prolong. At the heart of his program are stretches and motion exercises to restore proper function to muscles and joints. His methods are often surprising and counterintuitive. For example, for foot pain, he suggests a series of hip exercises. In fact, this is one of the most startling books you'll read about the human organism. Egoscue has strong opinions about how modern life is changing the way our bodies function, reducing the tasks we must perform and thus reducing the functional range of motion of our muscles and joints. Fortunately, he offers movement exercises to restore what nature meant us to have.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."
